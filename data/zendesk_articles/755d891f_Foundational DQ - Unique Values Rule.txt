Introduction
The "UNIQUE VALUES" rule evaluates whether the count of unique values within a particular dataset falls within an acceptable range or matches a specified number.
For instance, if there are 100 ship-from locations expected, the rule anticipates the count of unique locations to range between 95 and 100. An occurrence exceeding 100 suggests an error, typically due to duplicated or erroneous entries. Conversely, if the count falls below 95, it signifies a potential error, often attributable to missing or incomplete data.
By applying this rule, data analysts can ensure that the number of unique values conforms to expectations, thereby upholding data quality and reliability.
