Problem: When you run the address validation rule, it shows as invalid. The comments say, unknown error, contact administrator.
Common Reasons:
1. Incorrect configuration: Go to Configure tab of the table by clicking on configuration in the Rules Scorecard or from Profiling --> Show Details. Click to Edit and Save again so the system  checks the configuration. If there are any errors, it would prompt for the same
2. Web Service not able to write changes to staging table. (Administrator) go to Web Service log (dvsum\webservice\SAWS.log) and look for any errors in processing the request.
