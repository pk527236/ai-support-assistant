Introduction
The Foundational DQ Value Range Rule ensures that data values fall within an acceptable range, preventing incorrect or outlier values. This rule is crucial for maintaining data accuracy in fields such as transaction amounts, dates, and numerical identifiers.
For example, in manufacturing, the rule might enforce that the yield percentage should always be between 0.01 and 1. Similarly, in sales orders, the order type should be limited to specific values like ZOST, ZOCO, or ZOFR. In another scenario, for shipments, the item_category should only include values listed in the item_category reference.
By applying this rule, data integrity is maintained, ensuring that values are within acceptable boundaries or options, thus enhancing the reliability of analyses and processes relying on this data.
For further information about the rule detail page including scope, threshold, notifications, etc., please see the detailed article
Rule Detail page.
How to Set Up the Value Range Rule
Step 1: Navigate to Data Quality Rules
Log in to DvSum.
Go to Dictionaries > Database Tables.
Select the relevant Data Source and Table Name.
Step 2: Add a New Rule
Select the table name and go to the Data Quality tab.
Choose Available Rules.
Click on the ⊕ Add Rule button.
Select Foundational DQ and choose Value Range.
Step 3: Configure Rule Parameters
In the Rule Wizard's Basic Input section:
Rule Description: Enter a meaningful description.
Column Name: Select the column to apply the rule.
Comparison Type: Choose one of the three options:
Single Value
Range Value
Reference Dictionary
Single Value
As the name suggests, for a single value there is a single threshold. From the list of operators, you can define the threshold on a column name. When comparison type is mentioned then the user can further select 3 more options from Value which are:
Absolute Value
Expression
Reference Column
The above different Value types are explained below with examples for better understanding.
Consider an example, where we want to create a VR rule on "Population" which should be greater than equal to the "Relative Budget". Specifying this as a "Valid" range, this rule will show the records where "Population" is less than "Relative Budget" as exceptions.
Another example is that we can select the option "Absolute Rule Value" and in this case, only the value mentioned will be considered as valid value
Another example is that here we have defined an expression " > 100 " which means that the data will be valid where the column "Population" has values greater than 100:
One more example is that here we have defined an expression ">DATEADD(day, 7, CURRENT_DATE()) which means that the data will be valid where the column "Population" has values greater than 7 days from the current date.
Range Value
For the Range values, you need to provide the minimum and maximum threshold. Values which will be not in range will be marked as exceptions.
Reference Dictionary
In the Rule Wizard's Basic Input section, Select "Ref Dictionary" from dropdown in Comparison type.
Select the Dictionary and add relevant source fields.
If user selects,
Treat Empty Strings as Valid Values
: Empty strings ("") will be considered
valid
and allowed by the rule.
Treat Null as Valid Values:
NULL values will be considered
valid
. They’ll be treated as acceptable data
and allowed by the rule.
Ignore Case:
The rule will
not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase
characters.
For example, "Shipping" and "shipping" would be treated as
equal
.
