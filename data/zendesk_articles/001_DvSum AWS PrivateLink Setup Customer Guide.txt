Overview
This document provides comprehensive setup guidance for securely connecting to DvSum SaaS services using AWS PrivateLink. It enables private network access to REST APIs, WebSocket services, and S3 storage using the AWS network. All communication remains inside the AWS private backbone, improving security, reliability, and compliance for enterprise environments. The document also details required customer information, DvSum-provided configurations, step-by-step setup instructions, and validation procedures to establish AWS PrivateLink connectivity successfully.
Service Architecture
DvSum provides
three separate VPC Endpoint Services
for comprehensive private access:

Step-by-Step Setup Instructions
Step 1: Create VPC Endpoint for REST APIs (apis.dvsum.ai)
In the AWS Management Console, go to
VPC → Endpoints → Create Endpoint.
Under
Service Category Type
, select: “
Endpoint services that use NLBs and GWLBs
.”
In
Service Name
, paste the
REST API service name
provided by DvSum and click
Verify service
. It should get successfully verified.
Under
Network settings:
Choose your VPC.
Select at least
two private subnets
across different AZs for high availability.
Security Group
: Create or select the security group with the following Inbound and Outbound rules:
Inbound Rules:
Type
Protocol
Port
Source
HTTPS
TCP
443
Security Group ID of the machine or VPC CIDR
Outbound Rules:
Keep all outbound traffic allowed by default
Type
Protocol
Port Range
Destination
All Traffic
All
All
0.0.0.0/0
Click
Create Endpoint
.
After endpoint is created, its status will be
Pending Acceptance
, at this point, customers need to inform DvSum to accept the connection request.
Once DvSum accepts the connection request, endpoint status will change to
Available.
As the connection is in Available state, select the endpoint and from
Actions,
click on
Modify private DNS name
Under Modify private DNS name settings, select:
Enable private DNS names
and click on Save changes
Step 2: Create VPC Endpoint for WebSocket (socket-api.dvsum.ai)
In the AWS Management Console, go to
VPC → Endpoints → Create Endpoint.
Under
Service Category Type
, select: “
Endpoint services that use NLBs and GWLBs
.”
In
Service Name
, paste the
Socket service name
provided by DvSum and click
Verify service
. It should get successfully verified.
Under
Network settings:
Choose your VPC.
Select at least
two private subnets
across different AZs for high availability.\
Security Group
: Create or select the security group with the following Inbound and Outbound rules:
Inbound Rules:
Type
Protocol
Port
Source
HTTPS
TCP
443
Security Group ID of the machine or VPC CIDR
Outbound Rules:
Keep all outbound traffic allowed as by default
Type
Protocol
Port Range
Destination
All Traffic

All
0.0.0.0/0
Click
Create Endpoint
.
After endpoint is created, its status will be
Pending Acceptance
, at this point, customers need to inform DvSum to accept the connection request.
Once DvSum accepts the connection request, endpoint status will change to
Available.
As the connection is in Available state, select the endpoint and from
Actions,
click on
Modify private DNS name
Under Modify private DNS name settings, select:
Enable private DNS names
and click on Save changes
Step 3: Create VPC Endpoint for S3 (s3-storage.dvsum.ai)
In the AWS Management Console, go to
VPC → Endpoints → Create Endpoint.
Under
Service Category Type
, select: “
Endpoint services that use NLBs and GWLBs
.”
In
Service Name
, paste the
Socket service name
provided by DvSum and click
Verify service
. It should get successfully verified.
Under
Network settings:
Choose your VPC.
Select at least
two private subnets
across different AZs for high availability.
Security Group

Inbound Rules:
Type
Protocol
Port
Source
HTTPS
TCP
443
Security Group ID of the machine or VPC CIDR
Outbound Rules:

Available.
As the connection is in Available state, select the endpoint and from
Actions,
click on
Modify private DNS name
Under Modify private DNS name settings, select:
Enable private DNS names
and click on Save changes
Step 4: Notify DvSum for Endpoint Acceptance
Once all endpoints are created, their initial status will appear as
“Pending acceptance.”
DvSum must approve these requests before they become active.
Contact your DvSum representative and notify them that the VPC endpoints for the REST API, S3 and WebSocket services have been created in your AWS Account.
After DvSum accepts the requests, the endpoint status will change to
“Available.”
Step 5: Security Group Configuration
Configure your security groups to permit traffic between your applications and the new VPC endpoints.
Machine Security Group (Outbound Rules):
Keep all outbound traffic allowed as by default
Type
Protocol
Port Range
Destination
All Traffic
All
All
0.0.0.0/0
VPC Endpoint Security Group:
Inbound Rules:
Type
Protocol
Port
Source

Security Group ID of the machine or VPC CIDR
Outbound Rules:
Keep all outbound traffic allowed as by default
Type
Protocol
Port Range
Destination
All Traffic
All
All
0.0.0.0/0
Step 6: DNS and Connectivity Validation
Perform these tests from an EC2 instance inside your configured VPC.
1. DNS Resolution Test:
nslookup apis.dvsum.ai
nslookup socket-api.dvsum.ai
nslookup s3-storage.dvsum.ai
Expected Result:
Both domains should resolve to the private IP addresses of the interface endpoints within your VPC's CIDR range.
2. REST API and S3 Connectivity Test:
curl -v https://apis.dvsum.ai/health-check
curl -v https://s3-storage.dvsum.ai/health-check
Expected Result:
A JSON response: {"status": "ok"}.
3. WebSocket Connectivity Test:
openssl s_client -connect socket-api.dvsum.ai:443
Expected Result:
A successful TLS handshake, displaying the certificate chain and a "
CONNECTED
" message without errors.
Custom DNS Configuration
Note:
This step is to be followed only if
Private DNS is not enabled
on VPC Endpoints.
The following are the steps to configure DNS settings for the correct routing of traffic through three VPC endpoints via Private Link.
Step 1: Create Private Hosted Zone
In the AWS Management Console
, Go to Route 53 → Hosted Zones
Create Private Hosted Zone
:
Domain name
: dvsum.ai
Type
: Private hosted zone
VPC
: Associate with your application VPC
Step 2: Add DNS Records
Add A-records pointing to your endpoint private IPs:
Record Name
Target
apis.dvsum.ai
Private IPs of REST API VPC Interface Endpoint
socket-api.dvsum.ai
Private IPs of WebSocket VPC Interface Endpoint
s3-storage.dvsum.ai
Private IPs of S3 VPC Interface Endpoint
Advanced Troubleshooting
Network Connectivity Test
# Test from EC2 instance in your VPC  
telnet apis.dvsum.ai 443    
telnet socket-api.dvsum.ai 443 
telnet s3-storage.dvsum.ai 443
VPC Flow Logs Analysis
Enable VPC Flow Logs to monitor traffic patterns:
Monitor accepted vs. rejected connections
Identify security group misconfigurations
Track bandwidth utilization
DNS Resolution Debugging
# Check DNS resolution chain  
dig apis.dvsum.ai  
dig socket-api.dvsum.ai 
dig s3-storage.dvsum.ai
