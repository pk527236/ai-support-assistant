8. Lineage
Lineage
refers to the traceability of data through various stages in its lifecycle. It describes how data moves, transforms, and is used throughout an organization or system. Essentially, data lineage provides a "map" of the data's journey, showing where it originates, how it is processed, and where it is ultimately consumed.
For more information on lineage, refer to the article
Lineage in DvSum
.
9. Relationships
Relationships describe how different assets are connected to each other. In a well-structured data asset management system, relationships help link tables, datasets, and data elements to ensure data is organized logically and can be traced back to its origin.
For more information on adding relationship to asset, refer to the article
How to Manage Relationships Between Assets
.
10. Additional Info
The Additional Info tab allows users to add, edit, or remove supplementary information related to a table. It provides a text editor with formatting options (such as font style, size, color, and numbering) to include detailed notes or context as needed. Once the information is entered, users can save it as an item, modify or delete it, and choose to publish or discard the changes. Published additional information becomes part of the table’s details.
