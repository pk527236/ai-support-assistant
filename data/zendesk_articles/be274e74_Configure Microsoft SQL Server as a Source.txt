Overview
This article describes the steps needed to configure Microsoft SQL Server as a source in DvSum Data Catalog (DC). The same steps apply to configure a source in DvSum Data Quality (DQ) with only a slight variation.
Step-by-Step Configuration Guide

However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.
The connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.
