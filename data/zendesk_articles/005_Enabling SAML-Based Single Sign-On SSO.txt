Overview
SAML-based single sign on (SSO) gives members access to DvSum through an
 identity provider (IdP) of your choice.
SSO, or Single Sign-On, is a service for session and user authentication.
 It enables users to use a single set of login credentials to access multiple
 applications. This simplifies the management of various usernames and passwords
 for both enterprises and individuals.
DvSum enables you to secure your account by providing Web SSO capabilities
 based on popular standards such as SAML-based identity provider, allowing
 your enterprise user directory or third-party IdP to secure your applications
 via standards-based security tokens.
Certified identity providers:
ADFS
Microsoft Entra
Okta
OneLogin
Detailed Steps
Step 1: Log in to your Owner account
Go to the Administration tab → Account → Click on SSO
Step 2: Add Identity Provider
Click the button "Add Identity Provider" to navigate to the following form.
Step 3: Download DvSum SP Metadata
Download the DvSum SP Metadata file and configure your IdP to add DvSum as
 an application.
Step 4: Fill in Required Fields
Fill the form with all the required fields.
Provider Name
– Give a unique provider name in case you
 have multiple IdP's. The Provider Name cannot be updated once configured.
 Provider Name can only be alphanumeric, must be 3 to 32 characters long,
 must start with a letter, and cannot have special characters or spaces.
Identifier
– This is your company's domain name, e.g. mycompany.com.
IdP Metadata
– This is the metadata information from your
 Identity Provider. You can either provide a URL, or upload a local copy of
 the metadata file.
Attributes
– DvSum requires one attribute:
attribute: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress
value:
Email
Step 5: Save and View IdP Listing
Click Save. You will be directed to the IdP Listing page.
Step 6: Enable SSO in Test Mode
When a user enables the SSO Toggle button, they will be prompted with a confirmation.
 After clicking OK, SSO will be enabled in Test Mode.
After clicking OK, SSO will be enabled in Test Mode.
All administrators will receive an email notification informing them of this
 change.
Note:
In Test mode, Single Sign-On applies only to administrators
 who can test login using either corporate email ID or basic authentication
 credentials. Super users and regular users continue to log in with basic
 authentication.
Step 7: Enable SSO in Live Mode
After the Admin successfully verifies the SSO corporate login in Test mode,
 they can enable SSO in Live mode.
When SSO is made live, all active DvSum users will be required to use their
 SSO credentials to sign in. Their existing DvSum passwords will be deleted.
 An email notification will be sent to all active users.
An email will be sent to all active users and they will no longer be able
 to login using basic authentication.
Step 8: Adding Multiple Identity Providers
Add a new identifier and ensure it is different while keeping the Metadata
 URL the same. Save the changes. Both domains should now work with SSO.
Clicking "Sign in" will redirect to the identity provider (Okta).
Once the user is verified by Okta, they will be logged in to the application.
After Okta verifies the user, they will be logged into the application.
Step 9: Disable SSO
If the Owner turns off the SSO configuration from Manage Account, an email
 will be sent to all users.
Note:
When Single Sign-On is disabled, all users will be
 authenticated by the Basic Authentication process and will be required to
 set up a password.
