Introduction
The
Ruleset Rule
is a foundational Data Quality (DQ) check that combines three key validation rules:
Blanks Check
– Ensures that critical fields are not left empty.
Value Range Check
– Restricts values within a defined range.
Data Format Check
– Verifies that data follows a specified format (e.g., numerical, string, date).
By applying these checks, the
Ruleset Rule
helps maintain data accuracy, consistency, and completeness.
For further information about the rule detail page including scope, threshold, notifications, etc., please see the detailed article
Rule Detail page.
Why is it Important?
The
Ruleset Rule
plays a crucial role in preventing data quality issues, such as:
Missing Data
– Ensuring key fields like Customer_ID are always populated.
Incorrect Values
– Restricting inputs to valid predefined ranges.
Inconsistent Formatting
– Standardizing data representation for consistency across datasets.
For example:
Customer_ID cannot be blank
, ensuring no missing records.
The “Country” column must contain only two-character country codes (e.g., US, UK).
Date fields should follow the “YYYY-MM-DD” format.
By enforcing these rules, organizations can avoid incomplete or inaccurate records that may impact reporting and decision-making.
