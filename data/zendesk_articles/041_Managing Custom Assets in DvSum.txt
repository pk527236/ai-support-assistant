Overview
The DvSum DI Application supports
Custom Assets
, allowing organizations to define and manage asset types that align with their unique data landscape. This capability enables teams to create asset categories tailored to specific governance frameworks, business processes, and domain requirements.
Custom Assets are fully integrated into the DvSum platform—they appear in the asset feed, support Custom Attributes, and participate in workflows, lineage, and search. This ensures a flexible and consistent metadata experience across the catalog.
Defining a Custom Asset Type
Before creating a Custom Asset, the asset type must be defined. To do this:
Navigate to the
Asset Management
section from the left-side menu.
Click on
Asset Types
.
Click the
Add
button at the top right.
On the listing page, a predefined set of default asset types is displayed. These system-provided assets are visible even if no custom assets have been added. Any newly created custom assets will appear alongside these default entries.
This opens the
Add Asset Type
pop-up.
Enter the required details for the new asset type.
Click
Add
to save.
Customizing the Asset Type
Once the asset type is created, the
Asset Type Detail
page is displayed. This page acts as a
template
for all assets created using this type. Any configurations made here—such as custom attributes, tags, or relationships—will automatically apply to all assets of this type. Changes made to the asset type template will reflect across all associated assets.
Add or edit
Custom Attributes
Define
Tags
Set up
Relationships
with other asset types
These configurations allow you to enrich your custom asset with relevant metadata, improving its discoverability, traceability, and integration within workflows.
Configuring Relationships for an Asset Type
As part of configuring a custom asset type, you can define how it relates to other assets in the system using the
Relationships
section.
Navigate to the
Relationships
tab on the asset type detail page.
You can
add multiple relationship types
, each with a:
Relationship Type Name
(e.g., Contains, Governed By)
Target Asset Type
(e.g., BI Model and Report, Data Domain)
Each relationship type includes a checkbox that allows you to
enable or disable multi-asset linking
.
Enable this option to define relationships that support linking multiple assets of the selected type. For example, allowing an asset to be related to several database tables.
You can also remove a relationship type using the
trash can icon
under the Actions column.
Adding a Custom Asset
Once your custom asset type is configured, you can begin adding assets to the system.
Steps to Add a Custom Asset:
Navigate to the Assets Dictionary
From the
left-side navigation menu
, click on
Assets Dictionary
.
Click on "Add Asset"
In the
All Assets
section, click the green
Add Asset
button at the top right.
This will open a form where you can enter details for the new asset, including selecting the appropriate
Asset Type
, filling in standard and custom attributes, and establishing relationships.
Editing and Enriching the Asset
After adding a new asset, you’ll be directed to the
Asset Detail Page
, where you can view and manage all the metadata associated with the asset.
The configurations made on the
Asset Type Detail Page
—such as
Custom Attributes
,
Tags
, and
Relationships
—are automatically applied to the asset. From here, you can:
Edit or update custom attributes
(e.g., URLs, rich text fields)
Add additional relationships
to link the asset with other entities
Delete existing relationships
if they are no longer relevant
Assign or update ownership
via the
Managed By
section (e.g., Data Owner, Data Steward)
Add or modify tags
like Data Classification, Certification, or Dataset Quality
Include additional information
such as descriptions, data domains, and other contextual metadata
