Introduction
The
COUNT
rule is a type of Pipeline Check designed to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of data pipelines. It verifies data quantities, assesses data quality and performance, and monitors data timeliness within data processing workflows.
In essence, the
COUNT
rule checks whether the number of records falls within the expected range. For example, in an open order extract, the COUNT rule would verify if the count of sales orders is between
800,000 and 1 million records
.
This rule enhances data flow, quality, and efficiency by ensuring that the expected number of records is processed, maintaining consistency and reliability in data pipelines.
