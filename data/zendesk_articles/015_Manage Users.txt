Overview
DvSum provides administrators and owners with a robust set of features for adding and managing users. The
Users
page displays a list of existing users along with key details, including
Email, User Group, Status, Modified By, Modified On, Expiration Date,
and
Last Login.
This guide is designed for administrators responsible for managing user access and permissions in DvSum.
Adding New Users
When adding a new user, administrators can define the
Start Date
and
Expiration Date
for their account. These settings cannot be modified by the user:
The
Start Date
determines when the user gains access to the application.
The
Expiration Date
restricts access after the specified date unless an administrator extends it.
By default, the
Start Date
is set to the current date, and the
Expiration Date
is set one year later. Both fields can be edited by an administrator.
Steps to Add a New User
Navigate to
Administration > User Management > Users
.
Click
Add User
.
Enter the user's
Email
and assign a
User Group
.
Set the
Start Date
and
Expiration Date
.
Click
Save
to complete the process.
Note:
By default, the "Start Date" is set to the current date, and the "Expiration Date" is set to one year later. Both of these fields are editable.
Editing and Deactivating Users
User access is restricted to the period between their designated
Start Date
and
Expiration Date
. Administrators can manage user access through the
Actions
menu, which offers the following options:
Deactivate/Activate Users
– Temporarily disable or restore a user’s access.
Delete Users
– Permanently removes a user, updating their status to
Deleted
.
Reactivating a Deleted User
– If a deleted user is reactivated, they are treated as a newly added user and must be reconfigured accordingly.
