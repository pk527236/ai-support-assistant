Overview
All information about Data Quality (DQ) rules is accessible through the DvSum web user interface and is also available via API. Using the API provides users with greater flexibility and control over their DQ results. For example, you can integrate the data into a corporate BI tool or dashboard, or archive the results for future review.
The data retrieved via API corresponds to what is displayed on the
DQ Dictionary
page and is filtered based on the specific views of your rules that you define on this page.
Detailed Steps
Authentication Update
DvSum APIs now use
OAuth2 Client Credentials
for secure authentication instead of direct API keys.
To access APIs:
Navigate to Administration → Account → Application Security → Manage OAuth2 Clients.
Create an
Authentication Client
and download the generated
Client ID
and
Client Secret
.
or
Alternatively, enable API access at the user role level, and then generate a user role–based credential from
My Settings → API Credentials
tab.
Use these credentials to generate an
Access Token
using the Authentication API mentioned in the
API Documentation.
Refer to the article
‘API Access and Authentication Management’
for details on creating an authentication client and generating access tokens.

Making an API Call to Retrieve DQ Rules
To fetch a list of Data Quality (DQ) Rules, follow the steps below:
Key Information
Base URL
:
https://apis.dvsum.ai/node-listing/listing/rules?view-name=
Parameter
:

Example API Call
https://apis.dvsum.ai/node-listing/listing/rules?view-name=DQ Rules
Ensure to replace
view-name
with your desired DQ Rules view name as required.
Defining and Viewing DQ Rules in DvSum
To access and define views in DvSum, follow these steps:
Navigate to the DQ Dictionary
:
Go to the
Dictionary
dropdown and select the
DQ Rules
in the DvSum platform.
Select a View
:
Choose any available view to retrieve the rules and fields relevant to your needs.
Default View
:
The default view is
"DQ Rules"
, which is accessible to all users.
You can also define a custom view to specify the rules and fields you want to retrieve.
These views can be used as input parameters for API calls to fetch specific Data Quality rules and related fields.
Custom Views and API Extraction
When using
custom views
for API extraction, keep the following in mind:
Owner vs. Non-Owner Accounts:
If the view is created by the
owner account
, it is directly available for API calls.
If the view is created by a
non-owner account
, it must first be
shared with the owner account
before it can be used in the API.
Sharing a Custom View:
Navigate to the DQ Dictionary and locate the custom view you created.
Use the
share option
to share the view with the owner account.
Once shared, the owner can access the view, and it becomes available for API extraction.
Note:
If a custom view from a non-owner account is not shared with the owner, attempting to use it in an API call will result in no data being retrieved.
Testing with Postman
Below is an example where the selected view is
‘Analyze Rules’
.
The headers and the successful JSON response to the GET request are displayed.
