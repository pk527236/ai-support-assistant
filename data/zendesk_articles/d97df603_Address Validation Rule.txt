Title: Address Validation Rule
URL: https://dvsum.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360054484771-Address-Validation-Rule
================================================================================

Address validation, or address verification, is a rule ensuring that street and postal addresses are valid. It can be done upfront when a user searches for an incomplete or incorrect address, or by comparing and formatting data in a database with reference postal information.
In the application, there are changes in:
Staging Configuration (Profiling section)
Rule Detail (Workbench)
Staging Configuration for Address Validation Rules
Note
:
This setup is necessary only for the initial configuration on Oracle source. It's mandatory to complete this step; otherwise, during the execution of Address Validation rules, the user will receive an error message in the rule remarks stating "MM configurations missing."
Step 1 :
Navigate to Profile -> Profiling -> Select an Oracle data source, select main table and staging configuration table. In the below screenshot, main table is CUSTOMER_ADDRESSES and staging table is CUSTOMER_ADDRESSES_DVSUM.
Note:
It is required to make sure that Staging table exists for Address Validation rule to be run.
Step 2 :
Select main table and click on show details
Step 3 :
Select Staging configuration tab and click on Edit
Steps 4 :
Setting up Configuration, Additional Configuration, Staging Configuration fields
Configuration setup
Choose the Subject Area, set Golden Record Criteria, tick the Enable Validation checkbox, and provide a Description.
Additional Configuration setup
Verify the "Write-back Post Process" option, meaning enable it if the user intends to activate write-back on the main table. Additionally, specify the "Case type" preference, indicating whether the user wants to maintain the format of the Suggested Address as fetched by default, either in lower or UPPER case.
Staging Configuration
setup
Choose the Staging table, Match key, Match count, Match rule, Record identifier, Golden record ref, Record type, Merge status, Time stamp identifier, and then click the Save button located at the top, as illustrated below:
Step 5 :
Upon saving the changes, a success notification will inform the user that the modifications have been saved successfully. Simultaneously, an error message will appear, indicating that "Fields are not mapped to address data types Address Line 1 or Country." At the bottom, the Edit Mapping grid will be displayed as illustrated below:
Edit Mapping
Step 6 :
After configuring the staging settings, click on the Edit button to modify the mapping. Initially, Match Data Types are assigned randomly to column names, so the user needs to update these Address Match Data Types based on the required columns. The user can choose all columns by clicking Select All or include individual columns, as depicted below:
Step 7 :
Columns are mandatory to be mapped against following Address Match Data Types
City
Country
State
US ZIP code
ADDRESS LINE 1
Following address match data types will be mapped as:
Address Line 1 (Street Address)
Address Line 2 (Suit/Apartment)
Address Line 3 (Info/Atten)
Other Address Lines
Google response of street address will writeback to Address Line 1. Likewise suit/apartment, Info/Atten will writeback to Address line 2 and Address Line 3 respectively. In this way, the quality of addresses data will be improved.
Step 8 :  Completeness Rule
The default completeness rule is as follows:
"address_line1" is mandatory.
"country" is mandatory.
Either "city" or "zip_code" must be mandatory.
Users have the option to add this rule for all records or apply it selectively to specific filtered records. For instance, in the example provided, the `CUST_STATE` column is chosen as a mandatory field for all addresses where the country is set to 'US'.
Address Validation Rule
Step 9 :
Navigate to "Manage Rules," click on "Add Rule," and choose the Address Validation rule from the Process Quality category.
Step 10 :
Provide all the required fields here.
Note
: Table name field should be Main table not the staging configuration table as Rule will be created on Main table.
Step 11:
Visit the Rule Detail page and execute the rule, as shown below:
Step 12:
After the rule is executed, the following data is retrieved:
Run Status
Scanned Records (Total records got scanned)
Review Status
a. Pending (requires review)
b. Modified (if user accepts suggested address OR current address fetched from DB gets updated        and Saved)
c. Skipped (If user skips suggested address)
Commit Status
a. committed
b. commit failed
Readiness Score

Address Line 1, Address Line 2, Address Line 3, Other address lines, City, state, country are mapped together in Complete Address column.
Complete Address detail information is fetched from User's DB

Validated address is a bit changed from provided address (example: Henry Road, Henry St).
There is only
ZIP Code
deference between provided address, validated address (example: 63121, 63122).

There are following record statuses:
Update

Users can edit the current address in the review window, validate it, and receive a success or error message accordingly. The label next to the current address will show "Edited," and users can also revert to the original value if needed.
Review Window:
Step 17
When the record statuses are modified to Update, Skip, or Update, the count for pending records decreases, while the count for reviewed records increases.
Step 18

Step 19
Once user clicks Finish button given on bottom, then
Commit
