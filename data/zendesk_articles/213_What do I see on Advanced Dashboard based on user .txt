Dashboard gives you quick access to frequently used info.
On a
User level
, dashboard widgets help you see your involvement in the action items of DvSum application without going to individual functionality sections. For e.g. you can create a dashboard with a Rule Widget showing “Rule Count” by “Rule Status” in the form of a list. This shows all Rules created by you with their status: Pass, Fail or Exceptions.
On an
Admin/Owner level
, it is easier to track all user activity over the DvSum application on a single interface. Admins can filter out the data for a single user or view it for everyone using
