================================================================================

DvSum Owners can practice fine-grain or global access control over the categories of Business Glossary. This means only those users which have given access to a particular category will be able to
view
or
edit
the terms belonging to those category.
For example, if
Alice
manages (edit rights) the Category
Income. Bob
carries out some tasks over this category and he has edit rights for this category as well. However,
John
can only read (view rights) the terms defined under
Income.
If
Term1
is defined under
Income
. This means only Alice and Bob can be assigned the role of Term Owner or Term Steward. Bob can view the detail page of the terms but he wont be able to make any edit changes.
