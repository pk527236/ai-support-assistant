Scenario: Writeback from Flat to Classification table Mapping
Step 1:
In Order to Writeback to SAP Table using DB Source, First Verify the Record Identifiers are set for the SAP Table by Navigating to Profiling > Selected SAP Table > More Actions > Edit Configuration as shown below
Now Verify the Record Identifier’s in the below location. If the Record Identifier’s are not set, please set them here and Save.
Step 2:
Now, navigate to the DB Source Table (Ex: DVSUM.VW_ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE_FLAT) as shown below for which User wants to create a rule and do the writeback to SAP Table (Ex: ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE).
Step 3:
Verify the Record Identifiers are same as the SAP Table. If not, please select the record Identifiers for DB Source Table (Ex: DVSUM.VW_ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE_FLAT)
Step 4:
Select the SAP Table (Ex: ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE) To which user needs to writeback using DB source Table (Ex: DVSUM.VW_ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE_FLAT) as shown below, and Click on “Next”
Step 5:
Map the Key Identifier columns and Write-back columns of DB Table and SAP Table by using below screen. Perform the mapping as shown the below screens.
Here, As there are two Key Identifier’s(MATNR, ATTRIBUTE) in the Target (ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE) table, and in the source we have only one key identifier (MATNR_ARTICLE), The Field “ATTRIBUTE” is by default selected as Qualifier.
In Case of ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE_FLAT table, there will be only One Writeback Column. That Field Needs to be selected under “Write Back Column Mapping Selection”.
The “Qualifier Column Value” will be the “ATTRIBUTE” Column Value Where the Writeback will be performed in ZMAT_ATTRIBUTE table.
Once the mapping is completed for the Required/All columns that are used in the rule, Save the mapping by clicking on “Save” button.
