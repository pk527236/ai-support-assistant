================================================================================

You can control the data extraction limit on Azure blob or s3 by specifying the number of records to be uploaded.
This is the storage level option provided on Cloud storage tab. From Administration > Manage Account > Cloud storage > Add/edit
The Export Limit field is optional. If a user does not specify a value, by default 75,000 records will be uploaded. Valid range for this is 1 to at max 10 million records.
Note: If there are more exceptions than the limit, exception count will show on rule detail page but at the max 10M exception file will be uploaded to Azure/s3.
