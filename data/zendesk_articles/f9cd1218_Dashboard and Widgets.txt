Overview
A dashboard is a centralized interface that visually organizes and presents key data points, enabling users to monitor, analyze, and make informed decisions. In the DvSum application, dashboards provide an efficient way to manage and track data across various modules, offering customizable views and functionality. This article covers the types of dashboards available in DvSum, how to create and customize your own dashboards, and the options provided for sharing, downloading, and managing dashboard data. Whether using default dashboards or building your own, DvSum's
dashboard features help streamline data presentation and enhance decision-making.
