Introduction
Data quality refers to the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of data within an organization. High-quality data ensures better decision-making, compliance, and operational efficiency. The Data Quality tab in DvSum contains all the settings related to rules. Users can access the Recommended & Available Rules created for the table opened and create new rules. This article provides an overview of all the major options available in the Data Quality tab.
Edit Table
Edit the table details by clicking on the
Gear Icon
button
The following fields can be edited:
Load Profile
All Data
: Select this load profile if data is fully refreshed regularly.
Incremental Data
: Select this if data is normally loaded incrementally (appended).
Metric Time
: If the load profile is set to incremental, then select from the Data and Timestamp fields in the table. This field will be used in relevant DQ rules, such as calculating daily load volumes.
Exception Record Limit
Users can define a threshold for how many exceptions a rule can generate. For example, if the user does not want more than 500 exceptions for any rule created on the table, they can set this limit accordingly.
Filter Condition
The
Rich Filter Condition
allows users to specify specific conditions to apply to columns before executing rules. Users can add a
Filter Condition
or a
Custom Expression
. Multiple conditions and condition groups can be set as needed.
On the Rich Filters, users can add multiple conditions and condition groups according to the requirement
Note: Condition group joins various conditions (the ones in the silver box)
