================================================================================

You can determine the information you need in a view and then create one of the following DvSum Catalog views:
Scope View
RDBMS View
SAP View
Here is the detail of all three:
Scope View:
This view enables you to specify a logical scope of data relevant to you. You choose an existing data catalog object, set filtering criteria, and arrange fields in a layout that suits your preferences. It's a versatile view applicable to all types of data sources.
RDBMS View:
This view enables you to define a SQL-based view for joining and filtering multiple objects in a Relational Database (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server). It functions similarly to creating a database view, but without the obligation to do so. Subsequently, you can interact with this view in the same way you would with any table.
SAP View:
This view is designed for SAP-ECC and SAP-ISR data sources, allowing you to join various objects within SAP for data profiling and analysis.
