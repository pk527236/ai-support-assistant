Table Profiling
Rule Execution
Overview
Users can execute many different tasks in DvSum Data Catalog (DC). Testing a rule might take just a few seconds. But some rules could take several minutes or even longer. Therefore DC offers the ability to "
Run Online
" and "
Run Offline
" to give users the flexibility to run jobs as required.
Executing a rule synchronously and waiting to see the results is often the most efficient way to test a new rule. Executing a long-running job in the background and reviewing the results later is sometimes preferred.
Details

" or "
