What are Rule Groups?
Rule Groups serve as categorizing "labels" for organizing your audits into meaningful groups. By applying a Rule Group label, you can categorize your Audits according to your desired grouping. Unlike folders, Rule Groups allow for multiple labels to be assigned to a single audit and vice versa, where an audit can belong to multiple Rule Groups.
How to Create a new/ Assign existing Rule Group?
In case you want to add a new Rule Group or Assign an existing one to your Audit you can do that from multiple places.
1. Rule Detail Page
Adding a New Rule Group
Select any rule, Go To the Rule detail page, Click on the Edit Button, and navigate to the Notification Section. In the screenshot below you can see the option of "Rule Group". You can simply type in the name you want to give to the new Rule Group and press enter and the new rule will be added and assigned to your audit after you have saved it.
Adding single or multiple Existing Rule Groups
