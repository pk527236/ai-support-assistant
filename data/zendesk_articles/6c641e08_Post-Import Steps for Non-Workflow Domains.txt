Workflow Behavior After Import:
After completing the import,
records are not automatically published
.
In non-workflow domains:
Newly imported records will have
Draft
status
Updated records will have
Modified
status, this happens regardless of their previous status or the value provided in the import file
Steps:
1. Navigate to the Asset Type
Open the domain where the records were imported (e.g., Business Glossary, Data Dictionary, Field Dictionary).
2. Find Recently Imported Records
Apply a filter to a column
Last Updated On,
like:
Last Updated On → Greater than → Yesterday
3. Select Records to Update
Select the relevant records from the grid.
By default, clicking the checkbox on the top-left corner selects all records currently visible on the page.
To select all records in the current view (not just the visible page), click the
"Select all records in this view"
option that appears after selecting the first checkbox (as shown above).
Tip: There is
no hard limit on records
. The system allows bulk selection beyond 1000 records, provided you've filtered or configured the view accordingly.
4. Click Mass update.
5. Update Status
In the Mass Update modal:
Field
: Status
Value
: Published
Click
Submit
.
Confirm the status is updated to
Published
. Once the status is published, then you can verify the changes in the respective section where you modified.
Tip: Save a custom view with filters to repeat bulk updates easily.
Import File Behavior for the Status Field
The system ignores the Status value during import. All new records are set to
Draft
, and all updated records are set to
Modified
, regardless of whether the column is included or omitted.
Known Limitation
Automatic publishing or submission via import is not supported.
Manual action is required post-import
to submit both
newly added
and
updated
records for approval through the UI (e.g., via Mass Update).
