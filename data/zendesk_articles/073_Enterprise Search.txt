Summary
Overview
The
Enterprise Search
feature provides a unified way to explore and discover assets across your organization including datasets, reports, tables, rules, schemas, and more. It enables users to locate information quickly without needing to navigate through multiple modules.
Searching for Assets
Enterprise Search supports flexible search capabilities to help you find exactly what you are looking for.
Search Suggestions
As you type a query, Enterprise Search provides real-time suggestions to help refine your search.
If the system detects alternate or closely related terms, it displays a
“Did you mean…”
line above the suggestion list.
Users can click one of the suggested phrases to update the search term or press
Go
to execute the current query.
Fuzzy Search
Typos trigger “Did you mean…?” suggestions, while results are based on exact or prefix matches.
Expanded Search
Enable
Expanded Search
to include similar and partial matches for broader, more relevant results.
For example, if you search for
“Claim B”
with this option checked, results will also include assets containing the word
“Claim”
—not just exact matches.
This helps surface related or similar assets that might otherwise be missed.
Example Behavior
The “Did you mean…” line shows suggested alternative keywords.
The suggestions list shows recent or recommended searches and matching assets with basic metadata.
Clicking a suggestion or the “Did you mean…” phrase runs a new search with that term.
Search by Asset Name
Enter the full or partial name of any dataset, table, report, or rule to view all related results.
For example, typing
Sales
will bring up all assets whose names contain that keyword.
Note:
Exact matches to your entered keyword appear at the
top of the results
, allowing quick access to the most relevant tables, columns, or reports.
Search by Table and Column Name
You can search directly using a table name or column name.
If you add a period (
.
) and the column name after the table name (for example,
Orders.OrderDate
), the search will return all matching assets containing that column.
This also supports
full-path search
such as
DB.Schema.Table.Column
, allowing more precise targeting across complex data models.
Search by Unique Asset ID
Enterprise Search also allows searching through a specific
unique ID
of an asset.
This ID can be found in the URL of the asset (for example, a Power BI report or dataset).
Entering this ID in the search bar will return that particular asset directly.
You can also paste a
Power BI report URL
to locate that exact report in Enterprise Search.
Search by Custom Attribute Values
Assets with custom attributes such as picklist values can be located by searching those values.
For example, if a picklist attribute contains values like
Single
or
Double
, typing those terms in the search bar will display all assets assigned with that particular value.
In addition to standard assets, Enterprise Search supports a wider range of technical and custom objects including
databases, schemas, stored procedures, and custom assets
, ensuring broader visibility across your organization’s data catalog.
Using Filters
In addition to free-text search, users can apply filters to refine search results based on different asset characteristics.
Filtering Options
Filters in the left panel enable refinement of search results across asset types such as tables, columns, rules, terms, and agents. Each asset type provides its own set of filter categories, allowing more targeted exploration of data assets.
Filters available for All Assets
Data Owners -
Filter by the assigned data owner responsible for the Table.
Data Steward
- Filter by the assigned data steward responsible for the Table.
Data Domain
– Filter by assigned domain.
Last Updated On
- Filter based on the last updated date.
Status
– Filter based on Deleted, Default, New, Modified, and  Published.
Tags
– Filter by applied metadata tags.
Available Filters for Tables
You can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:
Format
– Filter by format of the data i.e. Files or Tables.
Last Refreshed On
– Filter based on the last scan or refresh date.
Record Count
– Filter by data size or volume.
Source
– Filter by data source name.
The available filter list changes dynamically based on the selected asset type.
Note:
Selecting the Plus (+) icon beside a filter reveals available options for more precise asset selection, such as tables, columns, rules, or agents.
Selecting Clear at the top of the filter section resets all applied filters.
Available Filters (for Columns)
You can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:
Data Type
– Filters by the column’s data type (e.g., String, Integer, Date).
Empty or Null
- Filters based on the number of empty or null values. Users can set the minimum and maximum limits for empty or null values to retrieve the desired columns.
Entity
– Filters by the related entity or object.
Table -
Filters based on the table names to which the columns belong.
Unique Count
– Filters by the distinct value count of a column.
Available Filters for Terms
You can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:
Sub-domain
– Filters by the sub-domain under which the term is classified.
Type
– Filters by term type (e.g., Business Term, Technical Term).
Filters for Rules
You can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:
Alert Status
– Filter by the alert level or current notification state.
Last Executed On
- Filters by the latest execution date.
Rule Type
– Filter by rule type such as Orphan Records, Missing Values, or Data Consistency.
Run Status
– Filter by the latest execution status (e.g., Valid, Invalid, Failed).
Search Results
Selecting a column from the search results opens a detailed panel on the right side, displaying key metadata and attributes
Selecting the arrow icon in the detail panel redirects to the Dictionary tab—specifically to the Database Column page—where the column can be viewed in full context along with related governance information.
Consistent Result Display
The presentation of search results has been standardized to ensure consistent metadata visibility and layout across all asset types.
This makes it easier to interpret and compare results within the Enterprise Search interface.
Example Search Scenarios
Searching
Orders
returns all tables and reports containing that table name.
Searching
Orders.OrderDate
lists all assets containing that column.
Entering a unique
Power BI asset ID
(from its URL) displays that specific report.
Searching
Lahore
returns all assets with that picklist value assigned in their custom attributes.
Pasting a
Power BI report URL
shows the matching report directly.
Applying filters for
Asset Type = “Data Quality Rule”
and
Status = “Published”
displays only published data quality rules.
Summary
Enterprise Search centralizes discovery across all connected data assets.
It helps you find, filter, and access the information you need faster and more efficiently.
Whether you are searching by name, column, ID, or URL, or refining results through filters and tags, Enterprise Search ensures that all relevant assets are easily within reach.
Note:
AI Agents are not included as part of Enterprise Search.
