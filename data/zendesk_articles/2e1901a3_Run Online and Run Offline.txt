Title: Run Online and Run Offline

================================================================================

Overview
Users can execute many different tasks in DvSum Data Quality (DQ). Testing a DQ rule might take just a few seconds. But some rules could take several minutes or even longer. Therefore DQ offers the ability to "
Run Online
" and "
Run Offline
" to give users the flexibility to run jobs as required.
Executing a rule synchronously and waiting to see the results is often the most efficient way to test a new rule. Executing a long-running job in the background and reviewing the results later is sometimes preferred.
Details
The option to "
Execute Now
" or "
Run Offline"
applies in several places.
Source cataloging
Table profiling
Rule execution
The options are complementary and give developers the flexibility to work as they prefer.
Run
Online
- Will immediately execute the action. Note that if the user navigates to another page while the task is executing, then the task will be aborted.
Run Offline
- Will schedule the action to run soon. Typically the task will begin execution within a few seconds. The job will be visible in the
Scheduler
tab (Review → Scheduler).
Source cataloging
