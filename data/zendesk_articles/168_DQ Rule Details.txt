URL: https://dvsum.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/17468996404756-DQ-Rule-Details
================================================================================

The latest update to our rule management system introduces offline and online execution capabilities, providing users with greater flexibility. The alert status of each rule is displayed as either "Healthy" or "Alerting" based on specified thresholds. Users can now easily edit rule definitions, descriptions, priorities, and scope, including window types and lookback days. Data aggregation into buckets enables detailed data quality checks. Various threshold types allow tracking and alerting based on exceptions. Rule notifications, action statuses, and scheduling options have been enhanced for improved rule management. The new history tab provides execution charts and grids for comprehensive performance analysis. Overall, these updates enhance rule customization, monitoring, and analysis.
Some of the major changes that have been implemented in the User Interface are highlighted in the
the screenshot below for a quick review.
The Rule Detail page has undergone significant changes, both in its interface and the introduction of new functionalities. Let's explore these enhancements in detail:

A notification at the top of the page is shown which indicates whether the rule is scheduled. If the rule is not scheduled it will not run automatically.
Alert status
