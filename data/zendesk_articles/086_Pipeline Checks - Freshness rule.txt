Introduction
The "Freshness" rule is a type of Pipeline Check that ensures the timeliness and reliability of data within data processing workflows. It verifies data quantities, assesses data quality and performance, and monitors if data is present or updated within a specified time frame.
In simple terms, the Freshness Check monitors whether data is available or updated within a certain timeframe. For instance, in a weather forecasting app, if data was initially fetched at "2023-09-30 08:00:00" and the next execution timestamp is "2023-09-30 14:30:00," resulting in a time difference of 6 hours, but the defined threshold is 3 hours, then the Freshness Check would alert because the difference exceeds the defined threshold.
This rule enhances the flow, quality, and efficiency of data processing by ensuring that data remains current and relevant, thus improving the reliability of the overall system.
For further information about the rule detail page including scope, threshold, notifications, etc., please see the detailed article
Rule Detail page.
