3. File Upload and Scan

File Actions
Click on the
three-dot menu
next to the uploaded file to access additional actions. You can choose to
Delete
or

the file as needed.
File uploads are manual:
Unlike other data sources (databases or APIs) that can fetch new data automatically during rescans, file-based sources do not update automatically.
User action required:
Users must manually upload new files each day to refresh the data; the system will not do this automatically.
After a file is uploaded and scanned, the following tabs are populated accordingly:
Overview Tab
Displays the detected tables and columns extracted from the scanned file.
Scan History Tab
Shows details of the scan, including timestamps and outcomes.
Logs Tab
Records system activities related to the scan for troubleshooting and tracking purposes.
Settings Tab
The
Settings
tab displays folder-related information, including:
Folder Name
and
Description
Access Information
on how to download files
Owner Details
Users can
Edit
folder settings or
Delete
the folder if needed.
Note:
Only profiling tables can be scheduled by creating a job.
Note:
When adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source. However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.
The connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.
