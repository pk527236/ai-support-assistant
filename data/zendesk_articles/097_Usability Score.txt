Required Metadata Fields for Full Score
Introduction
In DvSum, the
Usability Score
measures the completeness of a table’s metadata. A full score of
10
indicates that all essential metadata fields have been properly filled in, promoting better governance, discoverability, and trust in the data asset.
Note:
Full Score = 10
: Achieved when
all required metadata fields
are populated.
Partial Score
: If some fields are missing, the score is
calculated as the average
of the available metadata inputs.
If the Usability score is not 10/10 then the asset will considered as
Incomplete.
To mark an asset as Complete, the usability score must be updated to 10/10.
