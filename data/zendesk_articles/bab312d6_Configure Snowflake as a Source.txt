================================================================================

We continue to roll-out connectors to support bi-directional connection with Snowflake, where user can catalog, audit rules and the cleanse data without need for any external data pipelines. User will be able to add Snowflake as a source in DvSum and make customer's data insightful by Cataloging, Profiling , Executing rules and cleansing it. Let's get started.
