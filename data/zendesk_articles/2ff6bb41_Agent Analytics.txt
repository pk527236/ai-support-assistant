Overview
The new feature in our agent interface: the Analytics tab. This enhancement offers deep insights into agent engagement, top users, and detailed chat metrics.
Visibility of the Analytics Tab
The analytics tab appears only when the agent is shared with other users. To enable the analytics tab, share the agent with at least one other user. Once shared, the analytics tab becomes visible in the interface.
Analytics Tab
The Agent Analytics is divided into three main sections:
Agent Engagement
Top Users
Chats Listing
Agent Engagement
The Agent Engagement section provides a detailed overview of user interactions with the Agent. Here, you will find metrics on how many questions were asked by users and at what times. This section includes a graph that visualizes user activity over time and trends in user engagement.
Top Users
In the Top Users section, you can see a list of users ranked by their activity. This section displays the names of users and the total count of questions each has asked.
Chats Listing
The Chats Listing section is a overview of all chat interactions. It starts with four summary tiles:
Total Chats:
Total number of chats created.
Question:
Questions asked in the chats
With Feedback:
Questions with feedback
Users:
Users who have created the chat
Below these tiles is a detailed listing that includes the following columns:
Chat Name
Total Questions
Approved Feedback
Rejected Feedback

Copying and Exporting Data
The Analytics tab provides options to copy and export data from the Chats Listing section. Users can:
Copy:
Select and copy responses directly.
Copy with Headers:
Copy data along with column headers.
Export:
Download chat data for further analysis.
To use these options, right-click on any row in the Chats Listing table and choose the desired action from the context menu.
Managing Custom Views
The Analytics tab is designed to be customizable. By default, it features the Chats Analytics view, but users can create and manage custom views to suit their specific needs.
To create a new view click on the view, a drop-down will appear click on the Create View.
A modal will open. Add a name and details for the new view, and it will be created and displayed in the Analytics tab.
All the views created by the users will be shown in the drop-down.
