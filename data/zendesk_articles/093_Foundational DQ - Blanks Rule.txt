Introduction
The "BLANKS" rule addresses the availability and completeness of data within a dataset. It focuses on identifying whether there are any missing values present. This rule is particularly important for ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
For example, let's consider a dataset containing customer information, including ship-to addresses. The BLANKS rule might be applied to check if there are any records where the address field is empty or missing in the customer ship-to information. By enforcing this rule, one can ensure that all necessary data fields are populated, thus maintaining the quality and reliability of the dataset.
For further information about the rule detail page including scope, threshold, notifications, etc., please see the detailed article
Rule Detail page.
