Overview:
Tableau is a leading data visualization tool used for data analysis and business intelligence. We use Tableau as a data source in our DvSum Data Intelligence app. By adding and scanning the tableau source in our app, customer’s reports and tableau data sources will be fetched into our app to make the data more insightful to analyze. Let’s get started with Tableau. Now let’s get started with adding Tableau as a data source.
Prerequisites:
Before configuring Tableau as a data source, ensure you have:
Access to a
Tableau Server
or
Tableau Online
account.
Required connection details:
Server URL
Site ID
Authentication method
(Access Token)
Necessary API access and permissions for retrieving Tableau data.
User role with adequate permissions to access and fetch Tableau workbooks and datasets.
Step-by-Step Configuration
Step 1: Prepare Your Tableau Account
Log in to your
Tableau
account.
Ensure that some
datasets and workbooks
are available in your Tableau account.
Create new
workbooks
connected to the existing datasets.
Ensure that sheets are created within these workbooks.
The screenshot below shows multiple datasets and workbooks in the Tableau account:
Step 2: Add Tableau as a Source in DvSum
In the DvSum application, navigate to the Data Sources tab.
Click on the Add Source button.
Select Tableau from the list of available sources.
Provide a Source Name and click Save.
Step 3: Configure the Connection Settings
After creating the Tableau source, you will be redirected to the Connection Settings page.
In the Credentials section, enter the following details:
Server URL
Site Name
Access Token Name
Access Token Value
Click on Authenticate to verify the credentials.
Step 4: Save the Tableau Source
Once authentication is successful, scroll to the top of the page.
Click on the Done button in the top-right corner.
Click on Save to finalize the configuration.
After that click the “Save” button. The source will get saved successfully.
Note:
When adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source. However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.
The connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.
Step 5: Scan the Tableau Source
Navigate to the
Scan History
page.
Click the
Scan Now
button.
A scan job will be created.
Once the job status is
Completed
, the Tableau source scan will be successful.
Click on the
Scan Name
to open the
Scan Summary
page.
The
Scan Summary
page displays insights, including the number of
datasets and workbooks fetched
.
Step 6: Analyzing Tableau Reports and Datasets
Click on the Analytics
Dictionary
from the left navigation tab.
In the
Recently Refreshed
tab, view the fetched
Reports
and
Data Sets
.
Reports from Tableau scan:
From the listing select some recently scanned Report and the user will be redirected to the detail page of the Report. The screenshot below shows how the Reports detail page looks like.
On the detail page, a description of the report is fetched from the Tableau report. This means this report has the same description in Tableau and the same description is fetched and shows up here. The author of the report is basically the person who created this report in Tableau so this value is also basically fetched. Further, we have a lineage of the Report which actually shows us that the current Report is derived from which data set and which tables are connected to that data set.
Viewing Data Sets from the Tableau Scan
Select a recently scanned dataset from the listing.
You will be redirected to the
Dataset Detail page
.
The
Overview
tab displays the description and author fetched from Tableau.
The
Data
tab includes
Profiling Info
and
Field Summary.
The
Field View
section displays
Data Source
fields and
Data Connection
fields.
