Overview
This document describes the installation process for the DvSum Edge Gateway for DvSum Data Catalog and CADDI (DC). It covers all aspects of the installation including middleware needed and how to deploy the Gateway on a Linux machine.
For Windows, refer to
DvSum Edge Gateway Installation (SAWS) for Data Catalog and CADDI
.
Note:
Gateway, Connector, SAWS (Stand-Alone Web Service) and webservice are used interchangeably referring to the DvSum Edge Gateway.
Detailed Steps
Network Configuration
If the DvSum Gateway is installed on a server with restricted outside access to specific URLs, you'll need to whitelist the following addresses on the network. This will enable the DvSum Gateway to communicate with the DvSum SaaS application and ensure the service functions properly and securely connects to the necessary resources on the network. Please configure the network settings accordingly to allow for this communication.
URLs that must be whitelisted for outbound access on port 443:
https://apis.dvsum.ai
wss://3k7tif2dyi.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod
https://dvsum-app-data-prod.s3.amazonaws.com
Ports that must be open for inbound access from end user computers:
Default: 8183
Common alternative: 443
Linux Server Prerequisites
Ensure that your Linux distribution has systemd support and x86_64 server architecture.
# Confirm Architecture
lscpu
# Expected output includes:
# Architecture: x86_64
The minimum memory requirement is 2GB (with 4GB recommended).
The minimum disk space requirement is 1GB (with 5GB recommended).

Linux Configuration
It can be useful/desirable to connect to the gateway on the standard SSL port 443. There are multiple ways to achieve this. One common configuration technique is to redirect incoming traffic on port 443 to the DvSum Gateway listening on port 8183 using iptables.
sudo iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8183
Troubleshooting
Confirm that your gateway has started successfully and is now listening on port 8183.
netstat -at
# If the machine has many services, it can be useful to filter the output of netstat
netstat -at | grep 8183
Confirm that the machine is able to reach the DvSum SaaS application (confirm that it's not blocked by a firewall).
# Sample commands to confirm connectivity
