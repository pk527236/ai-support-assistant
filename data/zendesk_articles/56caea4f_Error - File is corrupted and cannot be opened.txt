================================================================================

Issue:
When attempting to open a downloaded report by clicking on the "Download report" link in Rule detail or via the link provided in the email alert, an error occurs where Excel displays the message "File is corrupt and cannot be opened."
Reason:
Excel prevents opening files downloaded from the internet, impacting not just DvSum but also files from colleagues or other websites.
Resolution:
Change the settings in Excel Options
Step 1: Open Excel --> Click on File --> Options
Step 2: Click on Trust Center on left menu
Step 3: Click on Trust Center Settings
Step 4: Click on Protected View
Step 5: Uncheck the first check-box
Step 6: Close Excel
Starting now, your files should open without any issues.
If changing your Trust Center settings isn't possible or you prefer not to, you can manually unblock the Excel file to open it.
Step 1: Navigate to the folder (e.g. Downloads) where the report is downloaded
Step 2: Right click on the excel file and click on Properties
Step3: Click on Unblock at the bottom of the dialog
Step4: Close dialog
Now this file can be opened in Excel.
