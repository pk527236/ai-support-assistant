================================================================================

First, identify the purpose of the chart. When you understand why you need to create a chart and with what information, you’ll be able to select the best chart type to make it more readable. There are several chart types available to you while creating a widget.
If you want to compare things, you may choose a
bar chart
,
line chart
or
list
.
If you want relationship analysis,
table
is the best option.
If you want to show distribution, you may go with a
column chart
.
If you want to show composition,
stacked column
or
bar charts
are preferred.
If you want to show trends over time, a
line chart
is a great option.
if you want to represent parts of a whole, a
donut chart
would work well.
