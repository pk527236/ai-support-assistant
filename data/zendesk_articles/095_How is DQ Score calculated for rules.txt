================================================================================

Introduction
The DQ Score helps assess how well a data quality rule is configured and ready for execution. A higher score indicates that the rule is properly set up, while a lower score suggests areas that may need improvement. It provides a precise overview of data quality and assists users in making relevant decisions.
DQ Score Calculation
The DQ Score is calculated slightly differently for different types of rules. The table below describes how the score is determined for each type of DvSum rule.
Rule Type
DQ Score Calculation
Count
Metric
If the threshold minimum is 0 and the result is less than or equal to 0, then the DQ score is 100%.
If the threshold minimum is not 0 and the result is less than or equal to the threshold minimum, then the DQ score is:
result/threshold minimum
If the result is greater than or equal to 2 times the threshold maximum, then the DQ score is zero.
If the result is greater than or equal to the threshold maximum but less than 2 times the threshold maximum, then the DQ score is:
(result - threshold maximum) / threshold maximum
Blank Check
Value Range
Ruleset
Orphan Records
Cross Dataset
Orphan Keys
Data Format
If there are no exceptions, then the DQ Score is 100%.
If there are exceptions, then the DQ Score is calculated as:
(total records - exception records) / total records
CUSTOM QUERY
If there are no exceptions, then the DQ score is 100%.
If there are exceptions, then the DQ score is:
(total records - exception records) / total records
If the total record count is less than the custom query count, then the DQ score is 0%.

Compare Metric
If the calculated result is less than or equal to the reference result, then the DQ score is:
calculated result/reference result
If the calculated result is greater than or equal to 2 times the reference result, then the DQ score is 0%.
If the calculated result is greater than or equal to the reference result, then the DQ score is:
(calculated result - reference result) / reference result
