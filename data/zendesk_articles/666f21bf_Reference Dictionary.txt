Title: Reference Dictionary

================================================================================

A Reference Dictionary is like a pre-organized reference book where users can create their own dictionaries, associating useful information with sets of values. This is helpful for DvSum validation audits, allowing users to choose a reference dictionary with a set of data values instead of listing individual ones.
For example, a user might create a "Hired Personnel 2017" dictionary with names and hiring dates of employees who joined in that year.
When setting up a "Value Range" audit to ensure only hired personnel are included in a column, you can easily select the reference dictionary you've created, rather than manually entering the range.
When you run the audit, it checks if your data matches the values in the reference dictionary you selected.
