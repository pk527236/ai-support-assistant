Overview
This article describes the steps needed to configure Oracle as a source in DvSum Data Intelligence (DI). The same steps apply to configure a source in DvSum Data Quality (DQ Legacy) with only a slight variation.
Prerequisites
Oracle configuration
User
: Create a user to be used in DvSum, or identify an existing user.
Table permissions
: Grant read-only access to the user for schemas and tables that you would like to catalog and profile.
System table permissions:
Grant read-only access to the user for the following system tables:
V$SQL
DBA_USERS
ALL_USERS
ALL_OBJECTS
ALL_TABLES
ALL_SYNONYMS
ALL_TAB_COMMENTS
ALL_EXTERNAL_TABLES
ALL_TAB_COLS
ALL_COL_COMMENTS
ALL_CONSTRAINTS
ALL_CONS_COLUMNS
In order to grant access the below statement can be used:
GRANT SELECT ON [TABLE_NAME] TO [USER]
Oracle GRANT documentation
Step by Step configuration
1. Add Source
To create a data source, navigate to Administration → Data Sources → ⊕Add Source.
Select Oracle.
Give the source a name, and save it.
2. Configure Connection
Once the source is saved, you will be redirected to the connection settings page.
Method 1: Connect Using DvSum Web Service
Whitelist the DvSum application by IP address as indicated.
Enter the required connection details:
Host
Port
SID or Service Name
Database Login
Database Password
Click
Authenticate
to verify the connection.
Method 2: Connect Using DvSum Edge Gateway
If your Oracle database is behind a firewall,
install a DvSum Edge Gateway
to enable a secure connection.

DvSum Web Service vs On-Premises Edge Gateway
.
Once authenticated, the
Database section
will appear.
Select the schemas to catalog.
3. Save the Connection
After entering credentials and selecting schemas, scroll to the top of the page.
Click
Done
in the top-right corner.
Click
Save
to finalize the connection setup.
Note:
When adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source. However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.
The connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.
4. Scan the data source
Navigate to the
Scan History
page.
Click
Scan Now
to initiate a scan.
Once the scan is complete, the status will update to
Completed
.
Click on the
Scan Name (e.g., SCN-000286)
to view the scan summary.
The
Scan Summary Page
provides insights into the scan, including:
The number of new tables and columns fetched.
Your Oracle connection is now fully configured and functional.
Browsing the Database Columns
After a successful scan, explore the discovered tables and columns:
Go to the Dictionaries dropdown and select the
Database Columns
tab.
Click on the
Recently Refreshed
tab to see the latest scanned tables.
Click on a table name to view detailed metadata.
Lineage Support for Oracle
DvSum supports lineage extraction for Oracle sources using query history and stored procedure or package code analysis.
To enable this:
Ensure the Oracle user has
read-only access
to the
ALL_SOURCE
view to allow access to stored procedure or package definitions.
All relevant schemas containing the procedure or package code must be included in the source configuration.
For detailed instructions on how to set this up, refer to the article:
Lineage in DvSum
Query History in Oracle
Query history is enabled by default for Oracle, so no additional configuration is required. DvSum automatically scans query history for lineage analysis.
To verify that query history is being captured, you can run the following SQL query:
SELECT v.*
FROM v$sql v
LEFT JOIN all_users du ON v.PARSING_USER_ID = du.user_id
WHERE command_type IN (1, 2, 6, 7, 189)
AND ROWNUM < 10;
Note
: This query returns recent DML operations using Oracle's
v$sql
view and can be used to confirm that query history is available to DvSum.
