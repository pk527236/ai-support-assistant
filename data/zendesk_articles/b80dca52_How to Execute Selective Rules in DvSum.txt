Overview
In
Data Intelligence (DI)
, rules help validate, cleanse, and monitor data quality. Sometimes, instead of running all rules at once, you may need to execute specific rules explicitly based on certain conditions.
By applying filters in the DQ Dictionary, you can isolate and execute only the necessary rules.
Steps to Run Rules Explicitly Using Filters
Step 1: Navigate to the DQ Dictionary Page
Go to the
Dictionaries
>
DQ Dictionary
section within your DI environment.
This section contains all configured
Data Quality (DQ) rules
in DI.
Step 2: Apply Filters to Isolate Specific Rules
Use the
search bar or filtering options
to locate the specific rules you need to run.
You can filter rules based on various attributes like
Rule ID, Rule Name, Rule Type,
or
Status.
Example: If you need to run
DQ-0001234 and DQ-0005678
, apply a filter to display only these rules.
After filtering, only the relevant rules will be listed.
Step 3: Select the Rules
Once the desired rules are displayed,
select them
by clicking the checkbox next to each rule.
Ensure that only the required rules are selected before proceeding.
Step 4: Execute the Rules Using 'Run Rule'
After selecting the rules, click the
"Run Rule"
button located at the
top right
of the page.
A dropdown will appear with two options:
Run Online
:
Executes the rule instantly and provides real-time results.
Note:
If you change the tab while the rule is running, the process will get
aborted
.
Run Offline
:
Runs the rule in the background (via a scheduler).
Results will be available after execution is complete.
Execution status can be checked later in the
Job section
Note:
This option is Recommended for
large datasets
or when running multiple rules simultaneously.
