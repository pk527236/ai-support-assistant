Steps to Enable Table Deletion
Overview:
Tables can only be deleted if their status is set to 'Deleted'. If an attempt is made to delete tables with any other status, as shown in the screenshot below, the system will display a pop-up message:
"No table(s) has been deleted."
To delete a table successfully, follow the steps below to change its status to 'Deleted' before proceeding with the deletion.
Steps to Enable Table Deletion
Navigate to the Administration >Data Source
Open the
Data Source
option from the left-hand menu.
Select the Table’s Source
Locate and select the source that contains the table you want to delete.
Go to
Settings
and select the
Connection
option.
Modify Schema Selection
Click the
Edit
button to open the
Schemas
page.
Identify the schema that contains the table.
Move the schema from
'Selected'
to
'Available'
to remove it from the data source.
Perform a Scan
Initiate a
scan
to update the system.
Once the scan is complete, the table’s status will be updated to
'Deleted'
.
Delete the Table
Once the status is set to
'Deleted'
, proceed with the table deletion.
Note:
For the Amazon S3 data source, updating the S3 buckets is required instead of moving the schema from 'Selected' to 'Available.'
