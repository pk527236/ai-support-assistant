================================================================================

In DvSum, there are multiple modules which send emails to notify information about respective modules. Most popular modules are Job Scheduling (Rules, Profiling, Batch), Data Quality Workflows and Data Management workflows. Previously, there was no control defined at account level for these emails to be received. With Email Optimization, we will be giving the control on user profile page (click user name at top right corner + click Profile option in the drop-down to navigate to User Profile) to set the frequency of the Notification Alert type.
You will be provided with the notification settings on the profile page through which respective flags can be controlled.
Notifications settings are segregated into following parts
Notification Frequency
Notification Type
Notification Frequency
Instant:
Notifications will be received as they were previously. Emails will be received right away as the event gets completed.
Hourly:
Notifications will be received on the hourly basis i.e all the set of actions performed in previous hour will be consolidated in a single email and then sent to the respective user. No emails will be received instantly then.
Daily:
Notifications will be received on the daily basis i.e all the set of actions performed in previous day will be consolidated in a single email and then sent to the respective user. No emails will be received instantly or hourly then.
Never:
Notifications will never be received on setting Never as frequency from the list.

Add on Feature - Receive Job Email as Creator
There was a request from our customer that they do not want to receive the email if they have scheduled a job unless they are explicitly added in the job as an internal recipient. So if it is disabled and you schedule a job with yourself added as recipient in that job, you will not be receiving the job completion email.
Enable to receive schedule email if you create the job.
Note: If you are the job creator and you have turned off the notification and added external user in that job, the external user will not be receiving the job completion email. The resolution is that you must have to select at-least one internal user in that job.
