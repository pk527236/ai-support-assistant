Note
DvSum enables users to apply different filter conditions while creating or customizing views in the Data Dictionary, Field Dictionary, Analytics Dictionary, and Business Glossary.
For detailed steps on creating Governance Views, refer to the
How to Create Governance Views article
. Once a view is created, filters can be applied using the specify criteria as described below.
Equals
What it does:
Returns rows where the column value exactly matches the specified value.
Example:
Source Name = Databricks → only rows where Source Name is "Adventure Works."
Does Not Equal
What it does:
Returns rows where the column value is not equal to the specified value.
Example:
Source Name ≠ Databricks → excludes rows where Source Name is "Adventure Works."
Includes
When using the
Includes
filter under
Specify Criteria
, the behavior varies depending on the selected field:
For Table Name:
When “Table Name” is selected, users need to
type a keyword
to search for available values from the database.
A message appears below the field saying:
“Type to search for values from database. You can select up to 100 values only.”
This means users must start typing to fetch matching table names, and they can
select a maximum of 100 values
.
For Other Fields:
For other filter fields (e.g., Columns, Tags, Source, etc.), the list of available values will automatically appear
when you click on the text box
, without the need to type a keyword.
Excludes
What it does:
Returns rows where the column does not contain the specified value.
Example:
Status excludes "Published" → omits rows where the Status field contains "Published."
Is Empty
What it does:
Returns rows where the column has no value (blank/null).
Example:
Glossary Term is empty → fetches rows with no glossary term assigned.
Not Empty
What it does:
Returns rows where the column contains any value (not blank/null).
Example:
Glossary Term not empty → fetches rows that have a glossary term assigned.
Wildcard Match
What it does:
Allows partial or pattern-based matching using wildcards (* or % depending on syntax).
Example:
Table Name wildcard match "order" → matches names like "order," "order history," or "vw order."
If * or % is used in the filter with *
"Add
"**, it will fetch all rows that start with
"Add."
Note:
Users can add multiple criteria within a single view.
