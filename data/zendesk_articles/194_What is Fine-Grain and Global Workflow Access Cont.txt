================================================================================

Workflow Control
The two levels of control provided to users over Workflows are
Workflow fine-grain access control
Global (when the checkbox for Workflow fine-grain access control is disabled)
Fine Grain Disabled (Global Access)
When fine grain checkbox is disabled, it means the users of a particular group are given global access to “all” the categories of Workflow.
On all categories, there are further 3 levels of access. i.e. Execute, Manage, No Access. An admin can set the access for a group from edit/add group dialog.
Execute Workflows
On Workflows Manage and Execution listing pages, all the WFs of all the categories will be visible to the users of that particular group. It means that the users can only view the WF list and details but cannot create or edit them.
Manage Workflows
On Workflows Manage and Execution listing pages, all the WFs of all the categories will be editable to the users of that particular group. It means that the users can edit the WF list and create and execute WFs.
No Access
For no access, User will be not able to see the WF listing on the Manage and Execution List pages.
