Overview
This guide outlines the steps to configure Amazon S3 as a data source within our SaaS application. It details the process of authenticating and adding your Amazon S3 source using one of two distinct methods, followed by running scans to retrieve your data.
Connect Your Amazon S3 Data Source
To integrate your data from Amazon S3, our platform offers two flexible connection methods:
1. Use Existing Resources (Connect to Your Existing S3 and Glue Setup)
Choose this option if you have already independently set up your Amazon S3 environment, including the creation of S3 buckets, AWS Glue databases, and crawlers. In this scenario, our platform will connect directly to your existing Glue Data Catalog to access your data. Because the necessary administrative tasks for your S3 data source have already been completed outside of our system, this method requires only limited permissions for our platform to read the metadata defined in your Glue databases.

2. Create New Resources (Platform Interface Setup)
Select this option to utilize our platform's user interface to create and manage the necessary AWS resources for accessing your S3 data. This allows you to define and build your data infrastructure directly within our application. You will have the ability to create S3 buckets, define AWS Glue databases, and set up crawlers through our intuitive interface. Consequently, this method requires elevated permissions to enable the creation and management of these resources on your AWS account.

Note:
If the action fails, the user should verify and check the following:
Certain special characters are not supported in column names. Examples of unsupported characters include:
Comma separator in column names (e.g., A,B)
Control characters (e.g., U+0000)
Ensure that there are no carriage returns within the column data, and it should be presented in a single line.
Step 3: Save Connection Information
After the credentials are authenticated, scroll to the top of the page.
Click the
Done
button in the top-right corner.
Click
Save
to save the source connection.
Finally, click
Test Connection
to verify the setup.
Note:
When adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source. However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.
The connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.
Step 4: Scan the Source
Navigate to the
Scan History Page
and click the
"Scan Now"
button.
A job will be created, and once its status shows
Completed
, the scan for the new Amazon S3 source will be finished successfully.
After the scan is complete, click on the
Scan Name
to open the
Scan Summary
page for this scan.
On the
Scan Summary
page, you will see insights from the scan, including the number of new tables and columns retrieved from the database that was selected earlier.
To gain more insights into the details of the tables, click on
"Data Dictionary"
from the sidebar. A table listing view will appear. Then, click on the
"Recently Refreshed"
tab. This tab will display all the tables fetched in the recent scan. Click on the table names to view more details on the respective table's detail page.
