Introduction
The Foundational DQ Data Format Rule ensures that data adheres to predefined formats, such as date formats, phone numbers, or email structures. This rule helps maintain consistency and prevents data entry errors that can lead to integration issues and failed validations.
For example, if Social Security Numbers (SSN) should follow the pattern XXXX-XXX-XXX, any deviation would be flagged as an error.
For further information about the rule detail page including scope, threshold, notifications, etc., please see the detailed article
Rule Detail page.
Use Cases & When to Apply It
The rule is particularly useful when:
Validating email addresses, phone numbers, dates, and other structured data.
Ensuring standardization across datasets before data integration.
Avoiding processing errors due to incorrect formatting.
Maintaining compliance with regulatory or business standards

Step 4: Configure Validation Conditions
Define the expected format using a valid regular expression. The actual regex syntax supported depends on the underlying database technology connected to DvSum.
Here are some commonly used patterns:
Email

^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w{2,}$
Matches
example@domain.com
Phone Number
→
^\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}$
Matches
(123) 456-7890
Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
→
^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$
Matches
2025-07-02
Postal Code (ZIP)
→
^\d{5}(-\d{4})?$
Matches
12345
or
12345-6789
Note: Since regex is evaluated at the database level, pattern support may vary by database (e.g., Snowflake, PostgreSQL). Always validate patterns against your specific data source.
