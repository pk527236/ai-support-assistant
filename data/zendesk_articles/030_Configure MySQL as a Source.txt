Overview
This article explains how to configure MySQL as a data source in DvSum for data cataloging and profiling. The steps apply to both DvSum Data Insights (DI) and DvSum Data Quality (DQ), with only minor variations depending on the platform.
Prerequisites
Before setting up MySQL as a source in DvSum, ensure the following:
Required Access & Configuration:
A running MySQL database (on-premises, cloud, or managed service like AWS RDS, Azure Database for MySQL)
General Query Log enabled (for tracking data lineage and usage patterns). See
Enabling General Query Log for Data Sources
for details.
Adding MySQL as a Source in DvSum
Step 1: Install and Set Up MySQL Locally
Install MySQL and MySQL Workbench on the machine where SAWS (Self-Hosted Agent Web Service) is running.
Ensure MySQL Workbench is configured properly.

Port
: Default is 3306
DB Login
: MySQL username
Password
: MySQL password
Click
Authenticate
.
Note:
MySQL Workbench and SAWS must be on the same machine; otherwise, authentication will fail.
Note:

Database Selection
field will appear.
Choose the schema to be scanned (single selection only).
Step 5: Save and Scan the Source
Scroll up and click

Note:
When adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source. However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.
The connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.
Go to

On the Scan Summary page, it will show all the insights of the scan i.e how many new tables and columns are fetched in this scan from the database that we selected earlier.
To have more insights into the tables' details:
Click on
"Data Dictionary"
