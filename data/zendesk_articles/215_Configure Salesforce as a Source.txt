================================================================================

Overview
DvSum Data Quality (DQ) supports a bi-directional connection with Salesforce, where a user can catalog data assets, author data quality rules, and even cleanse data without need for any external data pipelines.
Detailed Steps
Salesforce configuration
1. Connected App configuration
Open browser, navigate to salesforce.com, and log in.
https://login.salesforce.com/
Navigate to Setup → Apps → AppManager to create an app.
Tip: use the Quick Find box.
In the Connected Apps section, click "New Connected App".
Enter a name to be displayed to users when they log in to grant permissions to your app, along with a contact email address.
Enable OAuth Settings, and enter the relevant value in the Callback URL box:
For Data Quality:
https://prod.dvsum.com/cdata/saveVerifierCode
For Data Catalog:
https://apis.dvsum.ai/data-sources/sources/salesforce/saveVerifierCode
Select the scope of permissions that your app should request from the user. Save the changes and Continue to the next screen.
Click your app name to open a page with information about your app. Note the OAuth client credentials. These properties are needed to add Salesforce as a source in DvSum DQ:
Consumer Key
Consumer Secret
2. Permission Set configuration
The user connecting to Salesforce must have the ability to call Salesforce APIs. This is done by setting the relevant properties for the relevant Permission Set.
Access the relevant Permission Set via either of these 2 paths (the GUI layout will differ depending on whether Lightning Force or Classic view is active, but the logical path remains identical):
ADMINSTRATION → Users → Permission Sets → <permission_set>
or
ADMINSTRATION → Users → Users → <user> → Permission Set Assignments → <permission_set>
From here you need to activate System Permissions → API Enabled (Access any Salesforce.com API.)
With the Connected App and Permission Set configured, then you're ready to configure DvSum.

It will trigger authentication of DvSum's connection to Salesforce.
A success message should be displayed. Then click "Save".
Your Salesforce connection is now fully configured and functional.
