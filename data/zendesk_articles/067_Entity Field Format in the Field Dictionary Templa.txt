Overview
When working with the Field Dictionary in DvSum—either downloading or importing—you may notice that the
Entity
field contains dot-separated text. This format provides the full path of the entity, including its associated domain and subdomain.
Note:
The Entity field represents a glossary term in DvSum. While it also displays the full hierarchy including domain and subdomain (<DataDomain>.<SubDomain>.<EntityName>), its primary purpose is to map the field or column to the corresponding glossary term.
Entity Field Format
The
Entity
field uses the following structure:
<DataDomain>.<SubDomain>.<EntityName>
Example
Default.Default.US_PASSPORT
This structure ensures clarity when identifying entities that may exist under different domains or subdomains.
Field Dictionary Download
When downloading the Field Dictionary:
The
Entity
column will display the full hierarchy as described above.
The
Data Domain
column reflects the domain assigned to the column itself, which may be different from the domain shown in the Entity field.
Field Dictionary Import
When importing the Field Dictionary:
The
Entity
field must follow the format:
<DataDomain>.<SubDomain>.<EntityName>
This format is also reflected in the
sample file
that can be downloaded from the import screen. Use it as a reference when preparing your import.
Ensure any edits made to the Entity field maintain the correct format to avoid errors during import.
