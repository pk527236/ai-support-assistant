Key Feature of Glossary Terms
One of the powerful features of the
Glossary terms
in
DvSum
is its ability to automatically update linked columns when a change is made to a term.
How It Works:
If a
term
in the Business Glossary is linked to multiple
tables and columns
in different databases, any changes made to that term are
automatically reflected
across all linked columns.
For Example:
Edit the term
"First Name"
in the
Glossary Terms
.
Modify relevant details such as definition.
If a tag is
added
,
removed
, or
modified
on the term, all linked columns will immediately reflect the change.
Click
"Save"
to apply the changes.
Result:
The update is
automatically reflected
in all linked columns.
No manual updates are required in individual columns.
Before:
The term
"First Name"
has no tags assigned except "Sensitive tag".
A tag
"Test"
is added to the term
"First Name"
in the Glossary Terms.
After:
All columns linked to the term
"First Name"
now show the
"Test"
tag automatically along with the existing tag.
This eliminates the need to manually update individual columns, ensuring
consistency and accuracy
.
Auto Linking: Based on Name + Data Type
DvSum supports
auto-linking of glossary terms to dataset columns
based on:
Term Name
matching the
column name
Matching data type
This means that if a column name and data type match an existing term in the Glossary terms,
linking happens automatically
, reducing the need for manual mapping.
For example, a glossary term "Customer ID" of type
String
will auto-link to columns named "Customer ID" with type
String
in datasets.
Before and After Example
Before:
Glossary term "First Name" has only the "Sensitive tag"
Several columns are linked to this term but do not have the "Test" tag
Action:
The "Test" tag is added to the glossary term "First Name"
After:
All columns linked to "First Name" automatically inherit the "Test" tag
No changes were needed at the column level
This automated propagation maintains alignment across metadata and ensures ongoing data quality.
