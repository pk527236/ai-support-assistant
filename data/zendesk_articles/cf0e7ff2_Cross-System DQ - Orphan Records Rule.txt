Introduction
The "Orphan Record" rule identifies instances where a data entry exists in the records of one system but is absent from another system where it should be present based on expected data consistency between the two systems.
For example, if "Order A" is recorded in the list of orders within the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system but is missing from the Transportation System's list of planned orders, it indicates an orphan record situation. This discrepancy suggests that there may be inconsistencies between the two systems regarding the management or synchronization of order data.
Addressing orphan records typically involves aligning data between systems, ensuring data integrity, and establishing mechanisms to prevent such discrepancies in the future.
