Summary
Overview
A
Logical View
is an asset in DvSum that represents a
logical dataset defined using a SQL query
, independent of physical database tables.
While tables in DvSum are created directly from database metadata, Logical Views allow users to define datasets at a
logical or schema level
. This makes them useful for modeling filtered, derived, or analytical datasets that do not exist as standalone physical tables.
Logical Views behave like datasets within DvSum and can be viewed, managed, and used similarly to other assets.
Logical View as an Asset
Logical View is available as a
system asset type
and can be created from
Asset Management
.
These are visible in the
Asset Dictionary
and can be browsed and managed like other assets.
Creating a Logical View
To create a Logical View:
Navigate to
Asset Management
Click
Add Asset
Select
Logical View
as the Asset Type
Select the
Schema
Provide a
Name
and optional
Description
Save the asset
After saving, the Logical View opens in its dataset view.
Role of SQL Definition
The
SQL Definition
defines the query used to construct the Logical View.
Users can enter a SQL query that selects and filters data from one or more underlying tables or views. The result of this query represents the dataset exposed by the Logical View.
After entering the SQL query, click
Validate
to verify that the query is valid and can be executed successfully.
If validation is successful, a confirmation message is displayed.
A SQL definition can be used to:
Select specific columns
Filter records based on conditions
Apply business logic to shape the dataset
Once validated, the SQL definition can be saved and used as the Logical View’s data source.
Viewing a Logical View
After saving and validating the SQL definition, the Logical View behaves like a dataset within DvSum.
The

tab displays asset-level details
The

tab shows the dataset defined by the SQL
The
Data Quality
tab allows data quality rules to be applied
When to Use a Logical View
Logical Views are useful when:
Data needs to be represented logically rather than physically
A dataset is derived using filters or transformations
Physical tables do not align with analytical or validation needs
You want to apply data quality rules on a SQL-defined dataset
They provide flexibility without requiring changes to the underlying database.
Summary
Logical Views extend DvSum’s asset model by allowing users to define and manage
SQL-based logical datasets
independently of physical database tables.
They enable flexible data modeling, support analytical use cases, and integrate seamlessly with existing dataset and data quality workflows.
