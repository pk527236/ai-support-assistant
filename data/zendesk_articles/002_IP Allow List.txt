Overview
The
IP Allow List
feature lets administrators control access to the DvSum environment by specifying the network locations that are permitted to connect.
Only the IP addresses or ranges added to this list will be able to sign in or send API requests.
This setting is typically used to:
Restrict access to corporate networks, VPNs, or trusted data centers.
Prevent unauthorized logins from unknown or public networks.
Strengthen overall security and compliance posture.
Navigation Path
To access the IP Allow List feature, follow the below path:
Administration → Account → Application Security → IP Allow List
This section allows administrators to define and manage the list of approved IP addresses or ranges that are permitted to access the DvSum environment.
Configuration Steps
Follow the below steps to configure the IP Allow List.
