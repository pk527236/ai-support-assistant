Scope and When to Use This Guide
This guide walks users through the process of resetting their password in both standard (email/password) and SSO (Single Sign-On) environments.
You should use this guide if:
You've forgotten your password and can't log into your DvSum account.
You're using email/password-based authentication.
Your organization has disabled SSO and you need to access your account.
The guide is divided into two main sections:
Non-SSO Flow
– For standard email/password users.
SSO Flow
– For users switching from SSO to password-based login.
Non-SSO Flow: Resetting Your Password
For users with email/password authentication, follow the steps below to reset your password securely.
1. Initiate Password Reset
Navigate to the DvSum login page:
https://app.dvsum.ai
Click on the
"Forgot Password?"
link located below the password input field.
2. Verify Your Identity
Enter the
email address
associated with your DvSum account.
Click
"Reset my password"
.
Tip:
Ensure the email address is an exact match with what's registered in DvSum.
3. Retrieve Reset Code
Open your inbox and find the email from
DI Support
.
Locate the
6-digit verification code
in the email body.
If you don’t see the email:
Check your spam or junk folder.
If still not found, click on the “Resend Verification Email” button to receive a new code.
4. Create a New Password
Return to the DvSum
Password Reset
page.
Enter the 6-digit
verification code
.
Set a
new password
that meets the following criteria:
8–12 characters in length
At least
one uppercase
letter
At least
one number or special character
(
!@#$%
)
Cannot be the same as any of your
last 3 passwords
Confirm the new password by entering it again.
5. Complete the Process
Click
"Change Password"
to save changes.
You’ll be
automatically redirected
to the login page.
Sign in using your
email address and new password
.
SSO Flow: Resetting Password After Disabling SSO
If your organization has disabled Single Sign-On (SSO), users must log in using standard password authentication. The steps below outline how to reset your password after this transition.
1. Overview
SSO allows users to log in via their organization’s authentication provider. However, if SSO is disabled, users need to reset their password manually to regain access.
2. Disabling SSO (Admin Action)
Note:
This step is typically performed by an administrator.
Step 1: Navigate to SSO Settings
Log in to the
DvSum Application
.
Go to
Administration → Account Settings → SSO.
Step 2: Disable SSO Live Mode
Locate the
SSO Live Mode
toggle switch.
Click the toggle to
disable
SSO.
Step 3: Confirm the Action
A confirmation pop-up will appear.
Click
OK
to proceed.
Once disabled, all users will be required to log in using passwords instead of SSO.
3. Temporary Password Delivery
After SSO is disabled, a system-generated email with a
temporary password
is sent to each registered user's email address.
Didn’t receive the email?
Check your
spam/junk
folder.
Verify that the correct email address is used.
4. Log In & Reset Password
Use the
temporary password
from the email to log in at
https://app.dvsum.ai
.
Upon login, you’ll be prompted to set a
new password
.
Follow the same password rules mentioned earlier.
Click
"Save"
to update your credentials and complete the login process.
SSO Flow: Resetting Password when SSO is Live
Once SSO is enabled in
Live Mode
, DvSum no longer stores user passwords. All authentication is handled by your organization’s Identity Provider (IdP), such as Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), Okta, or Ping.
Password reset flow:
The
“Forgot Password”
link on the DvSum login page will no longer work.
Users must reset their password
directly in the Identity Provider (IdP) system
.
After resetting the password at the IdP, users can log in to DvSum using their updated SSO credentials.
DvSum support cannot reset passwords while SSO is Live.
If SSO is later disabled:
DvSum reverts to the standard login mechanism.
Users will need to set up new DvSum passwords using the regular password reset process described
How to Reset Password on the DI Platform
.
References:
Okta Support:
Password reset for users created via external IdP must be performed on the IdP.
Okta Support Article
Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) Support:
Users must reset their work or school passwords through Azure AD security info or mobile device if locked out.
Microsoft Support
AWS SSO with External Identity Provider:
Password reset is not allowed via AWS SSO when using an external identity source.
AWS Support
These references confirm that when SSO is active, password management is handled at the Identity Provider, not within the DvSum application itself. The linked DI Platform article provides step-by-step instructions for standard password resets when SSO is not active.
