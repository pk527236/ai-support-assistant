Overview
In databases,
empty
and
null
values may look similar but have different meanings. An
empty
value means an empty string (
''
) is stored in a column, especially in string-type fields. Understanding this difference is crucial, as the concept is used in
Blanks
and
Value Range Rule
checks. A
null
means no value has been stored—you'll see it
NULL
explicitly written in the database.
1. Understanding the concept of Empty Strings
Before jumping into the application, let's try to understand the concept directly from the database. Here, we have a column named
"capital"
, and we can see that empty strings are stored in it—these are empty values:
Now, if we check the same column in the application, we can see that the
"capital"
column has some empty values.
If we apply the
Blanks Rule
with the
"Empty"
checkbox selected, 4 exceptions are expected. Navigate to the
Blanks Rule
and apply this check.
Note:
Selecting at least one of the checkboxes is necessary to save the Blanks Rule.
After saving and running the rule, the number of exceptions will be
4
, which is the expected result.
This same check for
empty strings
can also be used in the
Value Range Rule
, and the concept remains the same as explained above.
2. Understanding the concept of Nulls
Now, let’s consider the same
"capital"
column. In the database, we can see entries where it
[NULL]
is mentioned—these are the
null
values.
From the profiling information in the application, we can see that the
"capital"
column also has some null values.
If we apply the
Blanks Rule
with the
"Null"
checkbox selected, the expected number of exceptions will be
284
.
As shown earlier, the same check is available in the
Value Range Rule
, and the concept is identical. In the
Ruleset Rule
, both
Blanks
and
Value Range
checks are available, and the logic remains the same.
