Step 1: Add External Email Addresses in the Job Notification Tab

Click on the Job ID for which you want to add an external recipient.
Click
Edit
on the selected job.

This step is important:
Only after pressing Enter
will the email address be properly saved.
Once saved, the email will appear enclosed in a box.
Step 2: Handle Domain Whitelisting
If you encounter an warning saying that the domain (e.g.,
gmail.com
,
yahoo.com
) is
not whitelisted
, perform the following:
Go to
Administration
>
Account
.
Navigate to
User Security
>
External Domains
.
Click on
Add Domain
.
Enter the domain name (e.g.,
gmail.com
) and
save
it.
Step 3: Verify the Email Address
After whitelisting the domain, return to the Job Notification tab.
Re-enter the external email address.
Press Enter
to save it properly.
The email should now be accepted without any errors and displayed in a box format.
Adding Multiple Recipients:
Users can enter multiple external email addresses, provided each address belongs to a whitelisted domain.
