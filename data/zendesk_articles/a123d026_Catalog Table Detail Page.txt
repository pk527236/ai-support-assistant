================================================================================

Overview
DvSum DQ's Table Detail page provides an efficient look at table metadata, data, current data quality rules, suggested data quality rules, and more. Users can easily edit table details and manage rules, enabling seamless decision-making and data quality maintenance.
Sample View:
Finding the Table Detail Page
Data Catalog → Table Dictionary:
Profile → Profiling → View Catalog:
Functionality
Run Profiling
Data profiling will query the data source to gather metrics about the data. It will also generate suggested DQ rules based on the data and metadata that it discovers.
Profile Table → Run Online
This will promptly initiate the profiling process. A progress bar will display the ongoing progress. It's crucial to stay on the page during profiling, as it operates synchronously. Leaving the page will result in the cancellation of the profiling process.
Profile Table → Run Offline
This will schedule a profiling job to run in the background. The job will typically start within the next minute, and this is the recommended approach for profiling large tables that may require several minutes to complete. You can navigate to other pages without affecting the job, and the updated statistics will be available once the job finishes. Check the job status here:
Review → Scheduler.
The
Profile Table button will be
Yellow
if profiling has never run. Afterwards, it will change to
Blue.
Edit Table
Edit the table details by clicking on the
Edit Table
button.
The following fields can be edited:
Description
Table Type
Load profile
All Data - Select this load profile if data is fully refreshed regularly.
Incremental Data - Select this if data is normally loaded incrementally (appended).
If the load profile is set to incremental, then you should also set the Metric Time field.
Metric time - Select from the Data and Timestamp fields in the table. This field will be used in relevant DQ rules. For example, when calculating daily load volumes this field will be used to see which records were loaded in the last 24 hours.
