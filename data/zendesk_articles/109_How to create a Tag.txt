.
By default following tags are available. You can also use the already-created tags.

Tagset name and definition would be pre-populated as this information was already provided while creating a tagset.
- Applicable To
Using the Applicable To option, the User can enable/disable tagset for the Dataset, Fields, terms , Model & Report. If applicable To is unchecked for any Data asset, then the tag will not be shown for unchecked data assets.
- Only Single value Allowed
Users can select only one tag for tagset. Multiple selections of tags is not allowed if this option is enabled.

User can also add his own custom tag in the tagset from Data asset detail page.
Require Note when Tagging:
While linking a tag to any data asset user has to provide a note. Note will be shown when user hover over the tag.
- Make Tags Prominent:
Prominent tags with selected colors will be shown with the Data assets name on top of the detail page and Enterprise search.
