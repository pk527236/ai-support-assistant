Introduction
The "Metric" rule is a kind of Pipeline Check used to ensure data pipelines are working correctly. It focuses on verifying data quantities, checking data quality and performance, and keeping track of data timeliness in processing workflows. By doing so, it improves the flow, quality, and efficiency of data.
In simple terms, the Metric rule checks if the total amount of data falls within an expected range. For example, it might ensure that the sum of open order quantities is between 75 million and 100 million units. This rule is essential for maintaining accurate and efficient data processing.
