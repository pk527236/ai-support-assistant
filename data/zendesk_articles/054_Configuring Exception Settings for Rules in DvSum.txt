The
Exception Configuration
panel provides greater control over how exceptions are managed in DvSum. By customizing these settings, users can streamline exception handling, reduce alert fatigue, and improve traceability.
This article explains the purpose and functionality of the
Exception Configuration
panel and how to use it effectively.
Accessing the Exception Configuration Panel
To access the
Exception Configuration
panel:
To configure exception settings for a rule:
Navigate to the
Dictionaries
>
DQ Rules
.
Choose a rule from the
listing page
.
Go to the
Data Quality
tab.
Click on
Edit
to open the rule settings.
Select the
Notifications
section from the left panel.
Scroll down to locate the
Exception Configuration
panel.
Exception Configuration Options
The
Exception Configuration
panel includes the following options:
Alerting Exception Files
When enabled, this option generates exception files during rule execution.
These files can be used for auditing or further analysis.
Exceptions to Include
All Exceptions
: Includes all exceptions identified during the rule run.
New Exceptions Only
: Includes only exceptions that are new since the last execution.
Email Recipients
Allows users to define who should receive exception alerts.
You can select from default email groups or specify custom recipients.
These recipients will receive the exception notification email when the rule is run.
Enable Exception Tracing
Enabling
Exception Tracking
is required to identify and differentiate between
new
and
existing
exceptions during rule execution.
This feature uses a
key field
(e.g.,
customer_id
) to trace recurring exceptions across multiple runs. Once enabled, users can easily spot
new exceptions
, which are typically the primary focus during data quality reviews, along with the
existing exceptions
.
Note:
After enabling Exception Tracking and executing the rule, additional metadata columns will appear in the
Data
tab to support exception analysis.
New Metadata Columns in the Data Tab
When Exception Tracing is enabled, the following columns are added to the
Exception Deep Dive
view in the
Data
tab:
DV First Observed
– Timestamp of when the exception was first detected.
DV Status
– Indicates whether the exception is
New
or
Existing
.
DV Age
– Shows how long the exception has existed since it was first observed.
These columns help users monitor exception trends and prioritize remediation efforts more effectively.
Status
filter has been added, allowing users to quickly switch between viewing
All
,
New
, or
Existing
exceptions.
