Overview:
This article outlines the process of configuring Azure SQL or Azure Synapse Analytics as a data source in DvSum, enabling integration for data cataloging and profiling. The steps provided apply to both DvSum Data Insights (DI) and DvSum Data Quality (DQ), with only minor variations based on the specific platform.
Prerequisite: Enable Query History via Query Store
Before proceeding, ensure that
Query Store
is enabled on your Azure SQL Database or Azure Synapse Analytics instance. Query Store captures query history, which is required for lineage tracking and usage insights in DvSum. For detailed steps, refer to the article
Enabling Query History for Data Sources.
For step-by-step instructions on creating users, configuring Query Store, and setting up required permissions, refer to
