Overview
Data Domains help organize and manage data assets by grouping them into logical categories based on business or functional areas. Defining Domains and Sub-Domains makes it easier to manage ownership, improve governance, and maintain better visibility across all data.
Accessing Data Domains
Navigate to
Administration > Organization
.
Click on
Data Domains
.
The
Data Domains
page displays a list of all existing domains configured in the system.
Adding a New Data Domain
To create a new domain:
Click the
Add
button.
2. In the
Add Domain
form, provide:
Domain Name
Description
Data Steward
3. Select
Enable Metadata Workflow
to activate metadata management options.
Metadata Workflow: Enabled
The 'Workflow' dropdown under the 'Enable Metadata Workflow' section provides two available options:
1. Anyone can approve – Any assigned approver can approve the metadata update.
2. All need to approve – Every assigned approver must approve before publishing updates.
Note:
For complete details on governance roles and responsibilities, refer to the
Data Governance Roles and Responsibilities
article.
Sub-Domain Selection
The
“Choose Sub-Domains”
section allows the user to assign sub-domains to the new Data Domain.
Click the
Save
button to save the domain. Then the newly added domain will appear at the top of the listing. An icon will indicate that the domain has the workflow enabled, as shown below.
Steward that is selected while creating the Domain will be the one who will be editing the term and making the changes. Then changes will be sent for approval to the approver(s). Approver's job will be to review the changes made by the Steward and approve or reject them.

Go to the module where the update needs to be applied:
Asset Dictionary
Database Tables

. A
Mass Update
dialog box will appear.
Step 3: Configure the Update

Click
Apply
to confirm the update. A confirmation message will appear once the update is successful.
The updated Data Domain will now be visible under the
Data Domain
column for all selected records.
Note:
Data Domains can also be assigned to multiple assets through
relationships
, similar to how it is done for rules, as described in the next section.
Mass Update Data Domain for DQ Rules

Navigate to
DQ Rules
, select the rules wanted to update.
Select the Relationship to add the data domains.
3. Select the data domain that needs to added/updated.

.
Data Sub-Domain
The Data Sub-Domains section allows users to view, manage, and organize sub-domains associated with various data domains.
Sub-Domains are logical subdivisions within Data Domain, used to organize datasets at a more granular level. They enable structured classification, enhance metadata traceability, and support precise governance across the data catalog
Accessing Data Sub-Domains:
To access the
Data Sub-Domains
page:
Go to
Administration
>
Organization.
Click on
Data Sub-Domains
.
Adding a New Data Sub-Domain
To create a new Data Sub-Domain:
Click on the
Add
button
In the form, define:
Classification
Ownership
Governance
Choose the
Priority
level of importance from the dropdown options:
•
Normal
– Default priority level.
•
High
– Marks sub-domains requiring critical attention.
•
Low
– Used for less significant domains.
Once a domain is selected, the sub-domain will inherit the workflow settings from the domain. This means the sub-domain will have the same Workflow Type, Stewards, and Approvers as the parent domain. Click Save to save the sub-domain.
Click
Save
.
Note:
If the workflow is enabled in Domain then its associated sub-domain will inherit all the domain's workflow settings. And if the workflow is disabled in Domain, then workflow can be enabled separately for the associated sub-domain.
Approval & Access Behavior
Domains can be assigned to user groups. When a domain is linked to a group, approval is considered complete as soon as
any one
member of that group approves it, even though the approval request is issued to all members.
Note:
Group-based approval is
not supported
when working with Import Data sources. For file imports, only
individual users
can be assigned and must approve.
Mass Update Data Sub-Domain
The
Mass Update
feature allows users to update
Data Sub-Domain
for Glossary Terms assets modules:
Note:
Sub-Domains can only be assigned to
Glossary Terms
. For
Tables
and
Columns
, Sub-Domains cannot be added separately. In the case of Columns, Sub-Domains are automatically inherited when a Glossary Term is associated with the column.
Step 1: Go to Glossary Term and select the records for which Data Sub-domain needs update.
Step 2: A
Mass Update
dialog box will appear.
Step 3: Configure the Update.
Step 4: Click
Apply
to confirm the update. A confirmation message will appear once the update is successful.
Step 5: The updated
Data Domain
will now appear under the
Data Domain
column for all selected records.

Note: Users can edit the default Data Domain and Sub-Domain; however, they cannot delete them as these are system defaults.
