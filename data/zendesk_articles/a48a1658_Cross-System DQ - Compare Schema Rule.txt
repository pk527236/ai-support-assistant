Introduction
The "Compare Schema" rule involves a comprehensive examination of data from two distinct schemas to verify that they are consistent with each other.
Consider there is a scenario in which consistency of two schemas is to be checked. The Compare Schema Rule will compare the schema structure between two sources, highlight differences in tables and columns, include disparities in data types where applicable.
In essence, the Compare Schema rule ensures that data across different sources aligns accurately, providing insights into potential discrepancies or variations.
