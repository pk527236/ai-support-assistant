Overview
Integrating Salesforce with DvSum allows users to analyze CRM data, generate reports, and ensure data governance. This guide outlines the steps to configure Salesforce as a source in DvSum.
Step-by-Step Configuration
1. Configure a Connected App in Salesforce
Open the browser, navigate to
salesforce.com
, and log in.
Navigate to Setup → Apps → AppManager to create an app.
Tip:
Use the Quick Find box.
In the Connected Apps section, click "New Connected App".
Enter a name to be displayed to users when they log in to grant permissions to your app, along with a contact email address.
Enable
OAuth Settings
, and enter the relevant value in the
Callback URL

Select the scope of permissions that your app should request from the user. Save the changes and Continue to the next screen.
Click your app name to open a page with information about your app. Note the OAuth client credentials. These properties are needed to add Salesforce as a source in DvSum DQ:
Consumer Key
Consumer Secret
2. Configure Permission Sets in Salesforce
To connect to Salesforce, the user must have the necessary permissions to call Salesforce APIs. This is achieved by configuring the appropriate properties within the relevant Permission Set.
The Permission Set can be accessed through one of the following paths (the interface layout may vary depending on whether Lightning Experience or Classic view is used, but the navigation remains the same):
ADMINISTRATION → Users → Permission Sets → <permission_set>
ADMINISTRATION → Users → Users → <user> → Permission Set Assignments → <permission_set>
Once there, enable
System Permissions → API Enabled
to grant access to any Salesforce.com API.
Once the Connected App and Permission Set are configured, you can proceed with setting up DvSum.
