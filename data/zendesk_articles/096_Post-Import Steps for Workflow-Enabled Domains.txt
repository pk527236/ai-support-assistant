Workflow Behavior After Import:
After completing the import,
records are not automatically submitted for approval
.
In workflow-enabled domains:
Newly imported records
will have
Draft
status
Updated records
will have
Modified
status — regardless of their previous status or the value in the import file
To move records through the approval workflow, a
manual submission
is required after import.
Steps:
1. Navigate to the Asset Type
Open the domain where the records were imported (e.g., Business Glossary, Data Dictionary, Field Dictionary).
2. Find Recently Imported Records
Apply a filter to a column
Last Updated On,
like:
Last Updated On → Greater than → Yesterday
3. Select Records to Submit
Select the relevant records from the grid.
By default, clicking the checkbox on the top-left corner selects all records currently visible on the page.
2. To select all records in the current view (not just the visible page), click the
"Select all records in this view"
option that appears after selecting the first checkbox (as shown above).
Tip: There is
no hard limit on records
. The system allows bulk selection beyond 1000 records, provided you've filtered or configured the view accordingly.
4. Click
Mass Update
.
5.
Submit for Approval
In the Mass Edit modal:
Field
: Status
Value
:
Submit for Approval
Click
Submit
.
6.
Confirm
Records will now enter the
workflow process
and await approval.
7. Approve the Records (For Approver)
1. Go to the
Assigned to Me
section in the listing page of the relevant asset type.
2. Select the records → Click
Mass Update
→ Set
Status
to
Approved
→ Click
Submit
.
Import File Behavior for the Status Field
The system ignores the Status value during import. All new records are set to
Draft
, and all updated records are set to
Modified
, regardless of whether the column is included or omitted.
Regardless of the import type,
manual submission is always required
to trigger the approval workflow.
Known Limitation
Automatic publishing or submission via import is not supported.
Records
cannot be auto-submitted
into the workflow during import, even if the
Status
is set to
Published
in the import file.
Manual action is required post-import
to submit both
newly added
and
updated
records for approval through the UI (e.g., via Mass Update).
