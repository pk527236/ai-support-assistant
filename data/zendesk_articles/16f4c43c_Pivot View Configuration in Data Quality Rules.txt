Overview
The Pivot View in Data Quality Rules provides an interactive way to analyze exception data by grouping and aggregating records directly within the application. It allows users to summarize large volumes of exception data, identify patterns, and gain insights.
This article is part of the
Rule Detail Page
documentation. For information on the
Data tab
, including how exception data is generated and displayed, see
Rule Detail Page – Data Tab

Pivot View data can be exported to Excel, similar to the Data tab. When exported in Grid format, grouped columns are downloaded as individual columns in the Excel file.
