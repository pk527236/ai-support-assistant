Using API Documentation & Authentication Flow
Overview
DvSum provides a robust set of APIs that allow external systems to interact with the platform. These APIs can be used to:
Manage data elements (tables, fields, terms, etc.)
Trigger approval workflows
Automate repetitive tasks
Authentication is handled through
AWS Cognito client credentials
, ensuring secure machine-to-machine communication. This allows seamless integration with enterprise processes while maintaining high security standards.
Refer to
DvSum API Documentation
for comprehensive API documentation.
Authentication Methods
DvSum supports
two OAuth2-based authentication methods
for accessing its APIs.
Both methods use
AWS Cognito’s
client_credentials
flow
to obtain an
access_token
, and both provide access to the
same set of APIs.
The key difference lies in
who owns the credentials
and
how permissions (RBAC) are assigned.
Method 1: Service Authentication (Machine-to-Machine)
Uses
OAuth2 Client Credentials flow
via AWS Cognito.
Credentials (
client_id
and
client_secret
) are created under
Administration → Account → Application Security → Manage OAuth2 Clients
.
Represents a
service principal
with its own identity.
Permissions are
assigned directly to the auth client. No roles involved.
Ideal for
automated workflows, background jobs, or system integrations
without user involvement.
Method 2: User-Based Authentication
Also uses
OAuth2 Client Credentials flow
via AWS Cognito.
Requires updating the
role
to allow
API Access
and associating
scopes
with the role.
Credentials (
client_id
and
client_secret
) are created under
My Settings → API Credentials
for individual users.
Tokens inherit
user-specific roles and permissions
via RBAC.
Suitable for scenarios requiring
user context, auditing, or personalized access control.
Add a Client
Navigate to
Administration → Account → Application Security → Manage OAuth2 Clients
and click
Add
.
Definition
Provide a
Name
for the OAuth client and an optional
Description
.
Set the
Secret Rotation Interval
to define the duration after which the credentials expire. The interval can be set from
7 days to 1 year
.
Alternatively, select
Never Expires
. A warning message highlights that indefinite credentials increase security risks, and regular rotation is recommended.
These are machine-to-machine credentials, that are not tied to any user account. They act as independent identities for scripts or background processes accessing DvSum APIs.
Scope
Select which APIs the client should have access to:
All Scopes
– grants access to all APIs.
Specific Scopes
– grant access only to selected APIs.
Access Level
:
Read
access is enabled by default.
Write
access can be enabled where applicable (e.g., Asset Listing).
Configure Alerts
In the
Alert
tab, you can configure notifications to be sent when credentials are about to expire.
Internal Recipients
:
Select from available
Groups
or
Users
and move them to the
Selected
list.
The OAuth client creator is automatically added by default.
External Recipients
:
Enter comma-separated emails (e.g.,
example@email.com
).
Only emails from
whitelisted domains
are allowed.
Expiry Alerts
: Expiration alerts are sent
3 days before credential expiry
, then repeated daily until credentials are refreshed or rotated.
Generate and Store Credentials
Review all settings.
Click
Save
to generate the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
for authentication.
Important:
Credentials can only be viewed once. After closing the modal, they cannot be retrieved again.
Download and store them securely (e.g., password manager or encrypted vault).
The downloaded CSV file contains both the Client ID and Client Secret, as shown below.
Rotate API Credentials
If credentials are compromised or nearing expiry, you can
rotate
them.
Click the
More Options (⋮)
menu for the client.
Select
Rotate
.
Confirm Rotation
A message will confirm that new credentials will be generated.
Old credentials remain valid for
24 hours
, giving time to update integrations.
After 24 hours, old keys are automatically disabled.
Download New Credentials
Once rotated, new credentials are issued.
Copy or download them immediately — they cannot be viewed again after closing.
Note:
Remember to update all applications and services with the
new Client ID/Secret
before the old ones expire.
Delete API Clients
You can delete one or multiple OAuth2 clients if they are no longer required. Deletion immediately revokes access for the associated Client ID and Secret.
Delete an Individual Client
Click the
More Options (⋮)
menu next to the client.
Select
Delete
.
Confirm the deletion.
Bulk Delete Multiple Clients
Use the
main checkbox
at the top of the OAuth2 client list to select all displayed clients, or select individual checkboxes for multiple clients.
Once selected, the
Delete
option will appear at the top of the list.
Click
Delete
and confirm to remove all selected clients.
Note:
Deleting an OAuth2 client is irreversible. Any applications or integrations using the deleted credentials will immediately lose access. If access is still required, create a new client and update your systems with the new credentials.
View Assigned APIs
On the
Manage OAuth2 Clients
page, the
Resources
column shows how many APIs are assigned to each client.
Clicking the API count (e.g.,
“6 APIs”
) opens a detailed view of the assigned scopes.
The detailed view lists all APIs granted to the client, along with their
access levels
(Read, Write, Delete).
This helps administrators quickly verify which endpoints each client can access and adjust scope if needed.
Summary of Service-Based Authentication
Use the generated credentials to authenticate via
OAuth2 Client Credentials flow
.
Refer to the
API documentation
for details on endpoints, request formats, and sample payloads.
User Role–Based API Access
In addition to service-based authentication clients, DvSum also supports
user role–based credentials
. This allows administrators to enable API access tied directly to a user’s role.
Enable API Access for a Role
Navigate to
Administration → User Management → User Roles
.
Either add a new role or edit an existing one.
Go to the
API Access
tab.
Select
Enable API Access
.
Configure Role-Based API Access
Set a
Secret Rotation Interval
(e.g., 180 days) or choose
Never Expires
(not recommended).
Select the
APIs
this role should have access to.
By default, any APIs already available to the role in the UI are pre-selected.
Additional APIs can be enabled as needed.
Save the configuration.
Generate and Manage User Credentials
Once API access is enabled for a role:
Users assigned to that role will see a new
API Credentials
tab under
My Settings
.
From there, each user can:
Generate
their own Client ID and Secret.
Rotate
their credentials when needed.
Delete
their credentials if they are no longer required.
Notes:
The
expiry interval
is set at the role level by administrators. All users in that role inherit the same expiry.
Users
cannot change expiry
, but they can generate, rotate, and delete their own credentials.
The API access scope always reflects the permissions granted to the user role. If role permissions change, the user access changes automatically.
Once generated, users authenticate using the same flow as service-based clients: generate an
access token
via the Authentication API and use it in subsequent API calls.
API Credentials Tab Availability
By default, the
API Credentials
option under
My Settings
will appear
greyed out
for users.
To activate this tab, the user must be part of a
User Group
that is assigned to a
User Role with API Access enabled
.
API Credentials disabled before Role Assignment:
API Credentials Enabled after Role Assignment:
Manage Generated Credentials
Once the
API Credentials
tab is active and the user generates their credentials:
Download
: Just like with service-based clients, credentials must be
downloaded immediately
. They cannot be viewed again once the modal is closed.
Rotate
: Users can rotate their own credentials to issue a new secret. The old secret remains valid for 24 hours, after which it is automatically disabled.
Delete
: Users can delete their credentials if they are no longer required. A new set can be generated at any time as long as their role has API access enabled.
Note:
Rotation and deletion are managed at the
user level
, but
expiry
is controlled by the
role configuration
set by administrators.
Using API Documentation & Authentication Flow
All available DvSum APIs are listed in the official API documentation:
DvSum API Documentation
You can download the collection from this site and import it into
Postman
or another API client.
Before You Begin (Pre-requisites)
Before running the authentication request, make sure you have the following set up in
Postman
:
Create an Environment (if not already set):
Go to the
Environments
tab in Postman and create a new environment.
Add a variable named
authUrl
with the value:
auth.dvsum.ai
Click
Set active
to activate the environment.
Set up Headers for Authentication:
In the
Headers
tab of your authentication request (
/oauth2/token
), ensure the following keys and values are added:
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
Accept: application/json 
Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_clientid_secret>
Once these pre-requisites are complete, proceed with
Step 1: Authenticate with Client Credentials
as described below.
Step 1: Authenticate with Client Credentials
Use the
Client ID
and
Client Secret
you generated earlier to obtain an
access token
.
Open the
Authentication API
(first in the documentation).
Combine your Client ID and Secret in the format:
client_id:client_secret
Convert this string into
Base64 encoding
Once generated,
copy the encoded value
and
paste it into the Authorization header
in Postman as shown below:
Authorization: Basic <base64_encoded_clientid_secret>
When you send the request, the API will return an
access token
.
Step 2: Use the Access Token
The access token is a
Bearer token
valid for
1 hour
.
Copy this token and include it in the header for all subsequent API requests:
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
Step 3: Run an API Example
Once you have an access token, you can use it to call APIs that your client/role has access to.
Example request:
GET {{baseUrl}}/node-listing/gov-view?node_type=TBL&node_id=40837560
Headers:
Accept
:
application/json
Authorization
:
Bearer <your_access_token>
Running
Get Governance Views
API in Postman:
A successful call returns
200 OK
with the response payload.
Important Notes
Access is restricted to the APIs that were explicitly granted in the
Scope
tab when creating the client.
Tokens must be refreshed every hour using the same authentication API.
Tip:
Import the full Postman collection from the
DvSum API Documentation
for comprehensive examples of all available APIs.
