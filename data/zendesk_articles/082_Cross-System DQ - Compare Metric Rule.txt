Introduction
The "Compare Metric" rule involves assessing aggregated quantities or metrics from two distinct data sources to verify their consistency and detect any differences or discrepancies.
It denotes the process of examining aggregated quantities or metrics from two separate data sources to ensure alignment and identify any discrepancies or differences.
For instance, one might compare the total shipment volume for the last three months recorded in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system with the aggregated shipment volume data stored in the data warehouse. This comparison aims to validate that both sources provide consistent information regarding shipment volumes and to pinpoint any discrepancies between them.
In summary, the Compare Metric rule helps ensure data accuracy and reliability by examining combined metrics from various sources.
