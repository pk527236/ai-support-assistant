Introduction
The "Orphan Keys" rule identifies a situation where a group of records of a particular type exists in one system but is absent in another system where it should also be present, categorized by their shared attributes or types.
For instance, shipments designated for Customer X might be recorded in one system, but not included in another system's list of shipments organized by customer. Also, Product Category B could be listed among shipments, yet it doesn't appear in the list of products. This discrepancy points to a mismatch in data synchronization or categorization between the systems.
In summary, the Orphan Keys rule reveals differences between datasets in various systems, underlining the importance of organizing data consistently across different platforms.
