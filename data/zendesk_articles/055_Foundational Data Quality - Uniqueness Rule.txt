Overview
The "UNIQUENESS" rule ensures that values within a specific data element are unique across the dataset. This rule is crucial for maintaining data integrity by detecting and preventing duplicate entries.
For instance, if a customer table contains duplicate records for the same customer, the Uniqueness rule will identify these duplicates and display the duplicate keys along with their count. This helps users pinpoint and resolve data duplication issues efficiently.
For more details about the rule’s scope, threshold, notifications, and other configurations, refer to the
Rule Detail page.
