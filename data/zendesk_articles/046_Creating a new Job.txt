Overview:
A job in DvSum automates data validation, transformation, and integration tasks by executing a specified number of Data Quality (DQ) rules and profile tables. Jobs can be scheduled or triggered via API, but not both simultaneously. This guide walks you through creating a new job, configuring its parameters, and scheduling it for execution.
Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Navigate to the Job Creation Page
Log in to DvSum and navigate to the
DQ Rules
tab.
Select any rule, click on
More Actions
, and then
Add to Jobs
.
Step 2: Choose a Job
From the dropdown, select an already created job or click on
Create a New Job
.
If creating a new job, a dialog box will appear. Click
OK
.
Step 3: Configure Job Parameters
In the
Definition
tab, add a job description.
Choose the selection type:
Fixed
Dynamic
Applying Filters When Using Dynamic Selection
When configuring the
Selection Type
, if you choose
Dynamic
, filters must be applied to define which
rules or tables
will be included in the job at runtime.
To apply filters:
Select the
Dynamic
option under
Selection Type
.
Under the
Add Criteria
section, click
Add Condition Group
to define one or more filter conditions.
Once the conditions are set, click
Apply Filter
.
After applying the filter:
The
Selected Rules
or
Selected Tables
section will automatically populate based on the applied criteria.
These selections are
not editable
— you cannot manually add or remove individual items.
Note: If no filter conditions are applied, no rules or tables will be included dynamically in the job.
Step 4: Configure Notification Settings
In the
Notification
tab, you can define how and when email notifications are sent, and specify who should receive them.
Email Notification Options
When you first open the Notification tab, you'll see two options:
Send schedule completion email
Send email on job delay
Once
Send schedule completion email
is selected, an additional option appears:
Send email on alerts
All three options can be selected together. Here's what each one does:
Notification Option
Purpose
Send schedule completion email
Notifies recipients when the job finishes its scheduled execution.
Send email on alerts
Sends notifications when alert conditions are triggered during a job.
Send email on job delay
Alerts recipients if the job exceeds its expected duration.
Job Delay Alert Configuration
If
Send email on job delay
is selected, a configuration panel appears with the following settings:
Duration Threshold
Automatically Determined Duration
(default): Uses outlier detection (Interquartile Range) to identify delays.
Set Custom Duration
: Manually specify the maximum expected duration. An alert is triggered if the job exceeds this time.
Input format:
HH:MM:SS
Alert Frequency
Define how often reminder emails should be sent after a delay is detected.
Input format:
HH:MM:SS
Email Recipients
You can specify both internal and external recipients:
Internal Recipients
Select users or groups from the
Available
list.
Move selections to the
Selected
list using the arrow buttons.
At least one internal recipient is required.
External Recipients
Enter comma-separated email addresses.
Only emails from whitelisted domains are allowed.
Example:
example@email.com, another@email.com
Step 5: Set Job Scheduling Options
Navigate to the
Schedule
tab.
Choose a schedule type:
Scheduled
(For scheduled execution)
Execute via API
(Refer to the
Executing Job via API article
)

Additional Way to Add a Job: From the Job Detail Page
Apart from adding jobs via the DQ Dictionary tab, you can also add a job directly from the
Job Detail page
. This provides a convenient way to manage jobs and quickly add related jobs without navigating back to the dictionary.
How to add a job from the Job Detail page:
1-From administration Tab navigate to the
Jobs
drop down and select
Definitions
in the
DI tool
.
2- Click the
Add Job
button located at the top.
3- Follow the same steps to select rules, configure parameters, notifications, and scheduling as described earlier.
Cloning Jobs:
From the Job Detail page, you can also use the
More Actions
menu to quickly clone an existing job. This allows you to duplicate the job configuration and make adjustments without creating it from scratch.
Job can also be cloned from the
Job Detail page
by navigating to
Edit > Clone Job
.
Profile Tables
A
Profile Table
job is used to analyze the structure and quality of your data by generating profiling statistics on selected tables. Profiling helps you understand the characteristics of your data before applying rules or transformations.
Purpose of Profile Jobs
Identify data distribution and patterns.
Detect data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, or anomalies.
Gain insights into column-level statistics (null counts, distinct values, min/max, etc.).
How to Create a Profile Job
1. Job Category
Select
Profile Tables
as the job category. This specifies that the job will profile data instead of executing rules.
2. Follow the same steps to select tables, configure parameters, notifications, and scheduling as described earlier.
Scan Source
A
Scan Source
job is used to discover metadata from a data source, helping build a catalog of data assets. Optionally, the scan can include profiling and lineage for deeper insights.
Purpose of Scan Source Jobs
Discover and catalog datasets, tables, columns, and schemas
Generate metadata inventory for governance and data discovery
Optionally include profiling statistics and data lineage mapping
How to Create a Scan Source Job
Job Category
Select
Scan Source
as the job category. This indicates that the job will scan a data source for metadata.
Data Source and Scan Catalog Options
Choose the appropriate
Data Source
from the dropdown.
Under
Scan Catalog
, you can optionally select:
Profile
– to include profiling statistics in the scan
Lineage
– to analyze data relationships and flow
If neither option is selected, the job will schedule a
catalog-only scan
, capturing only metadata like table names, columns, and schema details.
Follow the same steps to configure parameters, notifications, and scheduling as described earlier.
