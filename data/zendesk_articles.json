This simplifies the management of various usernames and passwords\n for both enterprises and individuals.\nDvSum enables you to secure your account by providing Web SSO capabilities\n based on popular standards such as SAML-based identity provider, allowing\n your enterprise user directory or third-party IdP to secure your applications\n via standards-based security tokens.\nCertified identity providers:\nADFS\nMicrosoft Entra\nOkta\nOneLogin\nDetailed Steps\nStep 1: Log in to your Owner account\nGo to the Administration tab → Account → Click on SSO\nStep 2: Add Identity Provider\nClick the button \"Add Identity Provider\" to navigate to the following form.\nStep 3: Download DvSum SP Metadata\nDownload the DvSum SP Metadata file and configure your IdP to add DvSum as\n an application.\nStep 4: Fill in Required Fields\nFill the form with all the required fields.\nProvider Name\n– Give a unique provider name in case you\n have multiple IdP's. The Provider Name cannot be updated once configured.\n Provider Name can only be alphanumeric, must be 3 to 32 characters long,\n must start with a letter, and cannot have special characters or spaces.\nIdentifier\n– This is your company's domain name, e.g. mycompany.com.\nIdP Metadata\n– This is the metadata information from your\n Identity Provider. You can either provide a URL, or upload a local copy of\n the metadata file.\nAttributes\n– DvSum requires one attribute:\nattribute: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress\nvalue:\nEmail\nStep 5: Save and View IdP Listing\nClick Save. You will be directed to the IdP Listing page.\nStep 6: Enable SSO in Test Mode\nWhen a user enables the SSO Toggle button, they will be prompted with a confirmation.\n After clicking OK, SSO will be enabled in Test Mode.\nAfter clicking OK, SSO will be enabled in Test Mode.\nAll administrators will receive an email notification informing them of this\n change.\nNote:\nIn Test mode, Single Sign-On applies only to administrators\n who can test login using either corporate email ID or basic authentication\n credentials. Super users and regular users continue to log in with basic\n authentication.\nStep 7: Enable SSO in Live Mode\nAfter the Admin successfully verifies the SSO corporate login in Test mode,\n they can enable SSO in Live mode.\nWhen SSO is made live, all active DvSum users will be required to use their\n SSO credentials to sign in. Their existing DvSum passwords will be deleted.\n An email notification will be sent to all active users.\nAn email will be sent to all active users and they will no longer be able\n to login using basic authentication.\nStep 8: Adding Multiple Identity Providers\nAdd a new identifier and ensure it is different while keeping the Metadata\n URL the same. Save the changes. Both domains should now work with SSO.\nClicking \"Sign in\" will redirect to the identity provider (Okta).\nOnce the user is verified by Okta, they will be logged in to the application.\nAfter Okta verifies the user, they will be logged into the application.\nStep 9: Disable SSO\nIf the Owner turns off the SSO configuration from Manage Account, an email\n will be sent to all users.\nNote:\nWhen Single Sign-On is disabled, all users will be\n authenticated by the Basic Authentication process and will be required to\n set up a password.\nSAML Configuration to Okta\nPlease use the following\nlink\nto configure SAML integration for your Okta application.\nAdditional Reference: Microsoft Entra\nReference:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-setup-sso\nNote: For more details on reset password refer\nHow to Reset Password on the DI Platform\narticle.",

It details the process of authenticating and adding your Amazon S3 source using one of two distinct methods, followed by running scans to retrieve your data.\nConnect Your Amazon S3 Data Source\nTo integrate your data from Amazon S3, our platform offers two flexible connection methods:\n1. Use Existing Resources (Connect to Your Existing S3 and Glue Setup)\nChoose this option if you have already independently set up your Amazon S3 environment, including the creation of S3 buckets, AWS Glue databases, and crawlers. In this scenario, our platform will connect directly to your existing Glue Data Catalog to access your data. Because the necessary administrative tasks for your S3 data source have already been completed outside of our system, this method requires only limited permissions for our platform to read the metadata defined in your Glue databases.\nAmazon S3 Data Source Connection: Use Existing Resources (Limited Permissions)\n2. Create New Resources (Platform Interface Setup)\nSelect this option to utilize our platform's user interface to create and manage the necessary AWS resources for accessing your S3 data. This allows you to define and build your data infrastructure directly within our application. You will have the ability to create S3 buckets, define AWS Glue databases, and set up crawlers through our intuitive interface. Consequently, this method requires elevated permissions to enable the creation and management of these resources on your AWS account.\nConfigure S3 Data Source in DvSum (Elevated Permissions Required)\nOnce you've selected the connection method that aligns with your current setup and desired level of management, proceed with the relevant instructions to configure the necessary IAM user and assign the appropriate permissions.\nStep-by-Step Configuration\nStep 1: Add Amazon S3 as a Source\nNavigate to\nAdministration → Data Sources → ⊕ Add Source\n.\nSelect\nAmazon S3\nas the source type.\nProvide a name for the source and click\nSave\n.\nStep 2: Configure Connection\nAfter saving, you will be redirected to the connection settings page.\nEnable the checkbox for On-premise Web Service and select the Gateway, or use DvSum Web Services (default).\nIn the Credentials section, enter the AWS Access Key and Secret Key.\nClick Authenticate to verify the connection.\nNote:\nFor more information regarding On-premise Web Servic\ne installation, click\nhere\n.\n1. Note: By default, the Web Service type is set to Cloud. For additional details, refer\nDvSum Web Service vs On-Premises Gateway\n.\nIn the\nCredentials\nsection, provide the correct\nAWS Access Key\nand\nAWS Secret Key\n, then click\nAuthenticate\nto verify the source.\nHow to create an AWS IAM User to configure S3 Data Source in DvSum?\nS3 Configurations\nOnce authenticated, configure the S3 connection settings:\nSelect the\nRegion\n(e.g., US West - Oregon).\nWorkgroup\nand\nCatalog\nsettings align with your AWS Athena configuration. For typical setups, you can leave them blank.\nIf you've created custom catalogs or workgroups, enter their names as defined in your Athena environment.\nUnder\nGlue Database\n, select one or more databases from the\nAvailable\nlist and move them to the\nSelected\nlist.\nThese are fetched from the AWS Glue Data Catalog.\nConfiguring Data Retrieval\nScenario 1: Use an Existing Glue Catalog\nSelect the Glue\nCatalog\nfrom the dropdown menu, and input the\nStaging Bucket\nand\nFolder\n.\nScenario 2: Create a New Glue Catalog\nEnable 'Create New' button\nCreate Source Bucket:\nClick\n+ Create\nnext to\nS3 Source Bucket\n.\nDvSum recommends using the prefix\n\"dvsum-s3-source-\"\nto ensure a unique bucket name.\nEnter a valid bucket name (\nAWS Bucket Naming Rules\n) and click\nSave\n.

In environments with numerous tables and terms, granting individual access is crucial. Simply instructing users to avoid certain tables isn’t a practical approach.\nWhen assigning specific access levels—such as \"View\" for some tables or terms and \"Edit\" for others—it can become complex. However, DvSum’s\nUser Roles\nand\nFine Grain\nsettings enable administrators to precisely control access. They can define whether a user has viewing or editing privileges for each table or term.\nAnother key feature, alongside\nUser Roles\n, is\nModule Settings\n. Users can configure governance and workflow settings for different data domains or sub-domains. Additionally, at the table level, they can enable or disable features like\nChat with Data\nand\nData Quality\n. This article will provide further details on these capabilities.\nHow to Add a New User Role\nGo to Administration Tab and then Users Management > User Roles\nClick on User Roles.\nClick Add Role and enter a name for the new role.\nAssign a user group to the role (this group will define which users inherit the role’s permissions).\nConfigure access settings under Admin, System Catalog, and Business Glossary Tabs.\nClick Save Changes.\nFrom the Admin tab, users can select Admin permissions, which include options for No Admin, Admin, or custom permissions through fine-grained control.\nFine-Grained Control (Admin)\nDvSum allows administrators to assign\nNo Access\n,\nView\n, or\nEdit\npermissions to various sections of the Administration Panel. These permissions help tailor access for different user groups based on their responsibilities.\nHow Section-Level Permissions Work\nSome sections in the Administration Panel represent a group of related features. When you assign a permission level to such a section,\nthat level is automatically applied to all features within it\n.\nExample: Jobs Section\nThe\nJobs\nsection includes:\nJob Definition\nJob Execution\nIf you assign\nView\naccess to the\nJobs\nsection, users will be able to view both\nDefinition\nand\nExecution\n. Similarly, selecting\nEdit\nwill allow users to modify both.\nThis ensures consistent access control across related features without needing to configure each one individually.\nPermissions can be configured directly from the\nSystem Catalog\nand\nBusiness Glossary\ntabs.\nFine-Grained Control (System Catalog)\nFine Grain allows further control over Data Sources and Tables inside them for Catalog and the same goes for Terms in the Glossary. Imagine you're an Admin, and a colleague wants to edit a Snowflake catalog. With Fine Grain control, you can grant them edit permissions for that specific dataset.\nIn the above example, edit permissions will be granted to this user role only for the enabled data source. The admin can decide the level of access he wants to give, he can either give \"View & Chat\" or \"Edit\" Permissions. Now admin can further filter the data source by using the Table Exclusion criteria below.\nNote: There are two options for Table Exclusion criteria which are shown above.\nLet us say that in the data source to which you have given access, you do not want to give this user role access to the tables which have sensitive tags then you will need to mention the criteria like this:\nThis change would have reflected like this:\nOn the Admin account:\nThe both highlighted tables above won't be showing in my user account which will have the user role settings that are mentioned above because these tables have Sensitive tags. On the User account, it will show like this:\nHere not only did we restrict the access of this user to specific Tables but we further restricted the edit access of this user. Now this user can make edit changes on any of the tables.\nOne Important thing is that Fine Grain Control will only be available if the permission above selected is either Editor or Viewer, otherwise, Fine Grain Control won't show on the UI.\nFine-Grained Control (Business Glossary)\nImagine you're a Glossary admin with access to all domains and sub-domains. A glossary editor requests access to specific domains and terms within them, but you only want to display terms in this domain with the status \"Published.\" Fine Grain Control allows you to achieve this level of precision.\nThis can be achieved as follows:\nIn this instance, Edit Access is granted to the \"Securities\" domain and its sub-domains, along with the terms inside it. An additional filter is applied, ensuring that only terms with the status \"Published\" can be edited.\nFor Example, on the Admin Account, we have three terms that are not published:\nNow the User who will have the user role settings above won't be able to see the highlighted terms because they are fulfilling the exclusion criteria. Here is the view of User account:\nNote:\nFor complete details on user roles and responsibilities, refer to the\nData Governance Roles and Responsibilities\narticle\nConfiguring Module Settings in DvSum\nModule Settings control governance workflows, Chat with Data, and Data Quality features at a global level. These settings affect all users in the organization.\nHow to Access Module Settings\nGo to Administration > Account Settings > Module Settings.\nChoose from the three available module settings:\nGovernance\nChat with Data\nData Quality\nEnable or disable these settings as needed.\n1. Governance\nIn the\nGovernance\ntab, activating the\nData Governance\ncheckbox enables the workflow for domains and sub-domains. If this checkbox is disabled, the workflow option for a domain or sub-domain becomes inaccessible.\nSimilar to\nUser Roles\n,\nFine Grain Control\nin\nModule Settings\nallows for applying specific filters. When\nFine Grain\nis enabled, the\nDefault\nsettings appear with two options. If set to\nEnabled\n, any newly added domain will automatically have its workflow activated, removing the need for manual configuration.\nConsider this example: Governance is enabled for the domain\n\"Default\"\nand all terms within it. However, terms tagged as\n\"Restricted\"\nwill remain excluded from governance.\nNow once the governance is enabled user can enable workflow from the Data Domain or Sub domain:\nAfter the workflow is enabled every term in this domain will have governance enabled except for the term which has the tag \"Restricted\" as mentioned in the exclusion criteria:\nAnd the existing Term which has the exclusion criteria won't have governance enabled:\n2. Chat with Data\nWhen enabled, Chat with Data allows users to interact with datasets using AI-powered agents.\nHow to Configure Chat with Data\nNavigate to Module Settings > Chat with Data.\nEnable the Chat with Data Checkbox.\nSelect specific data sources for Chat with Data.\nUse Fine-Grained Control to exclude specific tables or columns (e.g., exclude columns tagged as \"Sensitive\").\nClick Save Changes.\nBelow the Default settings, the user can enable Chat with Data for specific tables. For example, if the user wants to enable agent for one specific source then that source can be moved to Enabled:\nThis can be further filtered by adding Table exclusion criteria or Column exclusion criteria. For Example if the user does not want to include some tables in agents that have the \"Restricted Tag\" and columns that have the \"Sensitive\" tag then these tables and columns will not be available on the agents of that particular source.\nSo the expected behavior would be that all the tables inside the Datasource \"Snowflake_4th_August\" will be included in agents except for the Tables that will have the tag \"Restricted\". Now here is an example of a table \"Dwh.Nyc City Bikes\" that has the exclusion criteria:\nAnd for columns that are excluded from the Agents will be excluded from the chat and shown like this:\n3. Data Quality\nWhen enabled, the\nData Quality\nmodule facilitates monitoring of data integrity and quality scores.\nHow to Enable Data Quality Monitoring\nNavigate to Module Settings > Data Quality.\nEnable the Data Quality Checkbox.\nSelect specific data sources for Data Quality monitoring.\nUse Fine-Grained Control to exclude specific tables or columns (e.g., exclude columns tagged as \"Sensitive\").\nClick Save Changes.\nBelow are the Default settings, the user can enable Data Quality for specific tables. For example, if the user wants to enable the Data quality tab for one specific source then that source can be moved to Enabled:\nThis can be further filtered by adding Table exclusion criteria or Column exclusion criteria. Like if the user wants to disable the DQ tab for tables that have the \"Restricted Tag\" and columns which have the \"Sensitive\" tag should be disabled in the chat.\nSo the expected behavior would be that all the tables inside the Datasource \"Snowflake_DWH\" will have the Data Quality tab enabled except for the Tables which will have the tag \"Restricted\":\nColumns that are not included in the Data Quality tab will simply not appear under the \"Details\" heading on the Data Quality tab:\nBest Practices for Assigning Roles and Configuring Module Settings\nAssign Admin roles only to necessary personnel to prevent unauthorized system modifications.\nUse Viewer roles for non-technical users who only need read-only access.\nEnable Fine-Grained Control to give selective permissions rather than broad access.\nRegularly review role assignments to ensure users have the correct level of access.\nUse module settings strategically to enable governance, Chat with Data, and Data Quality only where necessary.\nLink Between User Role and Module Settings\nUser role settings are specific to individual users, while module settings apply globally, affecting all associated users and the admin account. For instance, if the admin grants View and Chat access for certain sources in user roles, enabling Chat with Data in module settings is necessary to activate Chat topics. This establishes a kind of parent-child relationship between Module settings and User roles, but they can also function independently based on specific requirements.",

    "content": "Overview\nDuring Gateway installation, an SSL certificate is used to secure communication between the Gateway and other systems. DvSum supports two primary SSL certificate types: self-signed certificates and CA-signed certificates.\nThis article explains the difference between these certificate types, when each is typically used, and how they relate to the SSL configuration options available during Gateway installation.\nCertificate Types at a Glance\nGateway SSL configuration is based on how the certificate is trusted.\nThe two supported trust models are\nself-signed certificates\nand\nCA-signed certificates\n.\nThe SSL options available during installation define how the certificate and keystore are created or reused, rather than introducing different certificate types.\nSelf-Signed Certificates\nA self-signed certificate is generated by the Gateway itself during installation and is not issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.\nWhen this option is used\nSelf-signed certificates are commonly used when deploying non-production or test environments, running the Gateway\nwithin an internal or controlled network,\nor when external trust by browsers or third-party systems is not required.\nCharacteristics\nGenerated automatically during installation.\nNot trusted by browsers or external systems by default.\nMay require manual trust configuration if accessed externally.\nRelated Gateway installation option\nThis certificate type is generated when selecting\nGenerate a new certificate\noption during the\ngateway installation\n.\nCA-Signed Certificates\nA CA-signed certificate is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority, either internal or public. This option is typically used for production or externally accessible environments.\nWhen this option is used\nCA-signed certificates are commonly used when deploying the Gateway in production, when external systems or browsers must trust the Gateway, or when security or compliance requirements apply.\nCharacteristics\nTrusted by browsers and external systems.\nIssued by a Certificate Authority.\nRequires an existing certificate and corresponding private key.\nRelated Gateway installation options\nCA-signed certificates are used when selecting\nCreate a new keystore with your certificate\n,\nUse an existing keystore\n, or\nAdd certificates to an existing keystore\noption during\ngateway installation\n. These options allow a trusted certificate to be supplied or reused during installation.\nHow This Relates to Gateway Installation\nThe Gateway installer presents multiple SSL configuration options. These options control how certificates are generated, stored, or reused during setup.\nFrom a certificate perspective, the configuration always falls into one of two categories: using a self-signed certificate generated by the Gateway or using a CA-signed certificate provided during installation.\nRecommended Approach\nIn general, self-signed certificates are suitable for development or internal testing, while CA-signed certificates are recommended for production or externally accessible deployments.\nSelecting the appropriate certificate type helps ensure secure communication and aligns with deployment and security requirements.",

Preparation\nStep 1: Download the New Gateway Version\nDownload the latest gateway version.\nDvSum Gateway Installer Links\n.\nStep 2: Uninstall the Current Gateway Service\nBefore installing the new gateway, uninstall the existing version to prevent conflicts. Use the following command to uninstall the service:\n# Windows\n.\\dvsum_gateway_setup.bat uninstall\n# Linux\n./dvsum_gateway_setup.sh uninstall\nStep 3: Verify Uninstallation\nEnsure the service is no longer running:\n# Windows\n.\\dvsum_gateway_setup.bat status\n# Linux\n./dvsum_gateway_setup.bat status\nStep 4: Backup the Previous Version\nMove the current gateway folder to create a backup:\n# Windows\nRename the existing dvsum_gateway directory to <dvsum_gateway_1.2.3>\n# Linux\nmv\ndvsum_gateway/ dvsum_gateway_1.2.3/\n2. Configuration\nWindows\nStep 1: Set up a New Folder for the Latest Gateway\nCreate a new folder for the latest gateway files.\nStep 2: Extract the Gateway Files\nExtract the downloaded .zip file to the new folder. Avoid using the Downloads folder.\nStep 3: Migrate Previous Settings\nFor Gateway version\n1.3.8 and earlier\nYou can\ncopy the configuration and SSL files directly\nfrom the old gateway folder to the new one:\nconfiguration.properties\nssl_config.properties\nIf you are using a CA-signed certificate, also transfer the relevant certificate or keystore files:\ncp\ndvsum_gateway_1.2.3/my_domain.jks dvsum_gateway_1.2.4/my_domain.jks\nFor Gateway version\n2.0.0 and above\nDo\nnot\ncopy the configuration files from an older version (e.g.,\n1.x.x\n).\nInstead, manually create new\nconfiguration.properties\nand\nssl_config.properties\nfiles and populate them using the updated format.\nNote:\nConfiguration files can only be copied when upgrading\nwithin the same minor version range\n(e.g., from 2.0.x to another 2.0.x version).\nStep 4: Migrate existing scan and chat information\nCopy the data_analysis folder from the old installation to the new one.\nCopy the dq_analysis folder from the old installation to the new one.\nCopy the scan_output folder from the old installation to the new one.\nNot all installations have all of these folders. Copy the folders that you have, but it's fine if you do not have all of them.\nLinux\nStep 1: Set up a New Folder for the Latest Gateway\nCreate a new folder for the latest gateway installation:\nmkdir\ndvsum_gateway\nStep 2: Extract the Gateway Files\nExtract the .tar.gz file into the newly created folder:\ntar -xzf dvsum_gateway_latest.tar.gz -C dvsum_gateway/\nStep 3: Migrate Previous Settings\nFor Gateway version\n1.3.8 and earlier\nYou can\ncopy the configuration and SSL files directly\nfrom the old gateway folder to the new one:\nconfiguration.properties\nssl_config.properties\nIf you are using a CA-signed certificate, also transfer the relevant certificate or keystore files:\ncp\ndvsum_gateway_1.2.3/my_domain.jks dvsum_gateway_1.2.4/my_domain.jks\nFor Gateway version\n2.0.0 and above\nDo\nnot\ncopy the configuration files from an older version (e.g.,\n1.x.x\n).\nInstead, manually create new\nconfiguration.properties\nand\nssl_config.properties\nfiles and populate them using the updated format.\nNote:\nConfiguration files can only be copied when upgrading\nwithin the same minor version range\n(e.g., from 2.0.x to another 2.0.x version).\nStep 4: Migrate existing scan and chat information\nCopy the data_analysis folder from the old installation to the new one.\nCopy the dq_analysis folder from the old installation to the new one.\nCopy the scan_output folder from the old installation to the new one.\nNot all installations have all of these folders. Copy the folders that you have, but it's fine if you do not have all of them.\n3. Installation\nWindows\nAfter setting up the new gateway and transferring the necessary files, install the gateway:\n.\\dvsum_gateway_setup.bat install --ssl-option=4 --non-interactive\nNext, start the gateway:\nOpen PowerShell in Administrator mode.\nNavigate to the gateway folder:\ncd\nc:\\dvsum_gateway\nRun the install command:\n.\\dvsum_gateway_setup.bat install\nLinux\nTo complete the installation and start the gateway on Linux:\n./dvsum_gateway_setup.sh install --ssl-option=4 --non-interactive\nNotes on Certificate Handling\nFor\nself-signed certificates\n, if you don’t need to retain previous settings, you can follow the general installation steps in the Gateway Installation article.\nFor\nCA-signed certificates\n, it’s recommended to reuse the same keystore to avoid reconfiguring the private key and related settings. Simply copy the keystore from the previous installation to the new gateway folder to maintain secure communication.\nFinal Remarks\nEnsure that\nconfiguration.properties\nand\nssl_config.properties\nare correctly migrated/configure.\nKeeping a backup of the previous version is recommended to avoid potential issues with SSL configurations or other settings.\nFor CA-signed certificates, reusing the existing keystore simplifies the process, avoiding the need to track down the private key.",

Then it will generate a self-signed certificate that you can use immediately as well as a certificate signing request (CSR) that you can use to obtain a CA-signed certificate later.\nAdd certificates to an existing keystore\nChoice: 2\nUse this option when you have a DvSum keystore from a previous installation and you have an updated certificate that you want to use.\nYou will be prompted for the keystore location and password as well as the certificate location.\nHow to Use Your CA-Signed Certificate:\n1. A CSR file is utilized to obtain a CA-signed certificate from a Certificate Authority, such as GoDaddy or Digicert.\n2. Once obtained, you will receive a folder containing the certificate, which includes four files as illustrated.\n3. Copy these files and place them in the DvSum folder.\n4. Once copied, open PowerShell and select option 2.\n5. Provide the path to the keystore (obtained in step 1).\nAfter successful execution, the results can be observed by browsing to the gateway.\nCreate a new keystore with your certificate\nChoice: 3\nUse this option if you have a certificate and private key. The script will create a new keystore and save your certificate in the keystore.\nUse an existing keystore with certificate and private key\nChoice: 4\nUse this option if you already have a keystore fully configured with the appropriate SSL certificate. The script will update the DvSum gateway to use this keystore.\nAll the information of the keystore is displayed and the user is asked if it's the correct keystore, configuration is completed accordingly.\nUninstall the Gateway\nUse the following command to uninstall the gateway:\n# Uninstall the gateway\n.\\dvsum_gateway_setup.bat uninstall\nNote:\nAfter uninstalling the previous gateway, proceed with the new dvsum_gateway_setup.bat file in order to install the latest gateway.\nLinux Installation\nDownload the installer\nUse the link provided above. You can either download directly to the Linux server, or download to a desktop first and then upload to the Linux server. Your corporate firewalls and network policies will determine which is easier.\nDownload directly\nThe provided link redirects to the latest version of the download. As a best practice, it's good to determine what version of the installer you will download, and use that name when you save the file.\n# Simple curl command to see the redirected URL\n# Note the filename \"DvSum_1.2.3.tar.gz\" in the response\ncurl \"\nhttps://apis.dvsum.ai/admin/account/saws/download-gateway?env=linux&app=dc\"\n# response:\nhttps://dvsum-app-data-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/connector/linux/DvSum_1.2.3.tar.gz?AWSAccessKeyId=ASI..\n.\nNow that we have the filename \"DvSum_1.2.3.tar.gz\" from the command above,\n# Using the filename \"DvSum_1.2.3.tar.gz\" from the previous output\n# Run curl using the same URL as above but with these additional parameters\n# -L to follow the redirect\n# -o to specify the downloaded filename\ncurl -L -o DvSum_1.2.3.tar.gz \"\nhttps://apis.dvsum.ai/admin/account/saws/download-gateway?env=linux&app=dc\"\nDownload to desktop first\nIf you are unable to download directly to the Linux server, then you can download first to your desktop computer. From there upload to the Linux server using SCP or any other file transfer mechanism.\nUnzip the installer\n# Create a directory for the gateway\nmkdir /home/my_user/dvsum_gateway\n\n# Unzip the installer\n# In this example these directories are used:\n# /home/ubuntu/dvsum_installers\n# /home/ubuntu/dvsum_gateway\ncd /home/my_user/dvsum_gateway\ntar -vxzf ../dvsum_installers/DvSum_2.0.0.tar.gz\nPython\nPython3 must be installed. The installer will install the required packages. Administrators may optionally install these packages before running the installer.\n# Confirm Python version\n$ python --version\nPython 3.12.3\n\n# Install required packages manually (optional)\ncd /home/my_user/dvsum_gateway\npython3 -m venv ./python_service/venv\n./python_service/venv/bin/pip install --upgrade pip\n./python_service/venv/bin/pip install -r ./python_service/requirements.txt\nNon-interactive Installation\nThe non-interactive mode reads all relevant information from two properties files during the installation. This is the most common installation method.\nEdit\nconfiguration.properties\nSet the value for\napi.Key\nConfirm the value for\nport\nConfirm the value for\npython.service.port\nReview all other properties — in most cases, no updates are needed.\nNote:\nFor\nGateway version 1.3.8 and below\n, use the property names as listed above (\napi.Key\n,\nport\n,\npython.service.port\n).\nFor\nGateway version 2.0.0 and above\n, use the updated property names:\ndvsum.apiKey\ndvsum.port\ndvsum.pythonServicePort\nEdit\nssl_config.properties\nThe properties that you need to set in this file depend on the SSL option that you select when running the script.\nGenerate a cert (SSL Option 1): complete sections 1 and 2.\nAdd cert to existing keystore (SSL Option 2): complete sections 2 and 3.\nAdd cert to new keystore (SSL Option 3): complete sections 2 and 3.\nUse existing keystore (SSL Option 4): complete section 2.\nComments on section 2:\nKeystore Configuration\nThese settings define how the Java keystore is configured for SSL support.\n# 2. Keystore Configuration\n# ----------------------------------------\n# Settings for the Java keystore that will hold the SSL certificates\ndvsum.keystorePath= # Typically left blank. It will be named based on the domain_name.\ndvsum.keystorePass= # Use a strong password.\ndvsum.keyStoreType= # Typically left blank. Defaults to JKS if not specified.\ndvsum.alias= # Any name can be used. A descriptive alias like dvsum-gateway-cert is recommended.\nLaunch the installer\nUse the following command to execute the gateway setup script and proceed with the installation and configuration of the DvSum Gateway automatically, without requiring any user interaction.\n# In this example, Generate a cert (SSL Option 1) is selected.\n./dvsum_gateway_setup.sh --ssl-option=1 --non-interactive\nValidate the Gateway\nFollow these steps to verify if the installation succeeded.\n. Verify that the Gateway is accessible at: https://<your-domain>:<port>\n. Check the logs at ./logs/SAWS.log for any important messages\nInteractive Installation\nIn an interactive installation the installer will prompt you for all options and all properties that you need to provide.\nLaunch the installer\nUse the following command to access the gateway setup file and proceed with installing and configuring the DvSum Gateway.\n./dvsum_gateway_setup.sh\nAppendix\nUsing Port 443\nMost customers prefer to open the standard port for https, 443, rather than opening port 8183. The simplest way to achieve this is to simply redirect traffic from port 443 to port 8183.\nUbuntu example\n# Add the iptables rule.\nsudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8183\n\n# Install iptables-persistent if not already present.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install iptables-persistent\n\n# Save the current iptables rules\n# and ensure they start on reboot.\nsudo netfilter-persistent save\nsudo systemctl enable netfilter-persistent",

    "content": "In this Article:\nIntroduction\nAuthentication & Test Connection Logs\nParticular Scan Job Logs\nReading Logs on Scan Job Page\nCancelling the Scan\nAborting the Scan\nScheduled Scan Jobs\nIntroduction\nScanning is a very important part of the DvSum Application. It is bringing the Data from the Database to our application.\nDuring the scan, a lot of things are going on in the back-end like how DvSum Webservice is connected to the Database and how tables are profiled one by one in our application. Most of the part is Technical but there are some areas where normal users can find useful insights by checking the logs that are being generated when the data is coming in our application.\nWe will further explore how users can abort the ongoing scans.\n1- Authentication & Test Connection Logs\nWhen the credentials of any data source are authenticated, the database and schemas are selected, and \"Test Connection\" is passed then there are some basic logs that are generated like the connection is established with the database and the schemas in it. The generated logs can be seen in the \"Logs\" tab.\nAll the logs related to the Source can be found in this tab and they are generated in the below cases:\nCredentials are authenticated & Test Connection is passed\nTables are being scanned\nQuestions asked on Agent\nFor more information about adding a Data source here is the article\nAdding Snowflake as Data Source.\nThe Logs are being continuously generated at the back-end so in order to fetch the latest logs user will be required to click on the \"Refresh\" button icon. The search bar can also be used for searching particular words in the Logs.\n2- Particular Scan Job Logs\nWhen a scan is started, a Scan job is created for that particular scan in the \"Scan History\" tab.\nOn the Scan job page, only the logs that are related to the scanning of the tables are present. This can be more useful instead of looking for the whole source-related logs.\nLet us cover some flow how scans can be started, and cancelled, and how logs can be viewed. Since the Scans are of different types so for more information regarding different scans here is the article\nCataloging & Profiling Data Sources.\n2.1- Reading Logs on Scan Job Page\nAs soon as a scan is started, logs are generated on the scan job page. The Logs may not just appear as soon as the scan is started and they might take 3-5 minutes to start. As the logs are continuously being generated they need to be refreshed to bring the latest logs.\nSince the tables are being profiled during the scan so users can check the status that how many tables have been profiled. This can be done easily by looking at the logs or users can use the search bar to check that how many tables have been fetched into the application.\nOnce all the tables are profiled then the scan will be completed and the status will be changed from running to completed. When the scan is completed users can still see all the logs that were generated.\n2.2- Cancelling the Scan\nWhen a scan is started, before going to the running state, for a few seconds it goes scheduled. In this state, if any Scan Job page is opened and the user cancels the scan then that particular Scan job will be cancelled.\nOnce all the tables are profiled then the scan will be completed and the status will be changed from running to completed and the users can still see all the logs that were generated.\n2.3- Aborting the Scan\nWhen a scan is started it goes to the running state and it starts the catalog execution and tables are profiled one by one. During this state, if the running scan is cancelled then it will be aborted.\nOn the UI there will be an \"Abort Scan\" button visible and when it is clicked, the scan job will be aborted.\nPlease note that if a scan is running and some tables are refreshed/ profiled and the scan is now aborted, the tables which were already fetched into the application will not be affected.\n3- Scheduled Scan Jobs\nUsers have the option of running scheduled scans in which the scan will start running at a particular time mentioned by the user in the settings of the source. The logs generated in scheduled scans are the same as the on-demand scans.",

    "content": "In this Article:\nIntroduction\nCatalog Scan\nProfiling\nCatalog & Profile Scans\nCatalog, Profile & Lineage Scans\nScheduling a Job\nSpecial Cases for Certain Sources\nIntroduction\nTo get the data in the DvSum Catalog, the Data source should be Scanned from the database. The scanning process is divided further into three steps which are catalog scan,  profile scan & lineage scan. This article will show how to perform these three types of scans. Before moving further make sure that you know how to add a data source and how a source is authenticated. Here is the\nlink\nto the article that shows how to add an Oracle Data source.\nCatalog Scan\nCataloging the data source means that during the authentication there are some databases and schemas added and schemas further contain tables that have the data. When the source is authenticated then \"Scan Now\" button can be seen. When the \"Scan Now\" button is clicked it further shows two options:\nProfile\nLineage\nWhen the user doesn't select any of the above options the \"Catalog\" scan will run automatically. Catalog scan will run in any case.\nWhen any source is scanned using the scan type \"Catalog\" then a job will be scheduled with the scan type \"Catalog\".\nThe scan type can be will be shown in the job detail page.\nAfter few minutes the catalog step will be completed and the status will be changed from \"Running\" to \"Completed\".\nWhen the Scan is completed then scan information can be viewed by clicking on the \"Job Execution ID\". The scan results page shows us the total tables and columns that are scanned. The scan type is also mentioned on the Scan Results page.\nGo to the\nDictionary\ndropdown o\nn the Database tables tab\n, the data sources that are newly scanned can be seen. Since the data source was \"cataloged\" so the tables will come but there will be no records in the tables and it can be verified by looking at the record count which will be empty.\nProfiling\nOnly the columns in the tables are not useful until the data is not there so in order to bring data of the tables in the catalog, the table must be profiled. When any table is selected then \"Run Profiling\" button can be seen above.\nOn clicking \"Run Profiling\" the tables will be profiled (all the data present in the tables will be fetched in the catalog) and a job will be scheduled.\nWhen the Job will be completed then all the tables will be profiled. On the Database Tables tab there will be record count for the tables that were profiled indicating that the data is now present in the tables:\nNote: Scan Results tab for the scan type \"Profile\" does not exist\nCatalog & Profile Scans\nWhen the source is authenticated then on the \"Scan Now\" button there is an option of \"Profile\" which is a combination of cataloging and profiling (full scan). It will bring the schemas and tables along with the data inside them in the catalog. Once the \"Scan\" button is clicked, a scan job will be created of the type \"Catalog & Profile\" will be created.\nOnce the scan is completed, the scan details information can be seen by clicking on the Job ID  which will open up the job detail page which contains all the information related to the scan along with the scan type:\nGo to the\nDictionaries\ndropdown o\nn the Database Tables tab, all the tables along with the data will be present in the catalog. Here we do not require profiling separately as it was done during the scan.\nIt is to be noted that scan type \"Catalog & Profile\" basically brings all the schemas and tables present inside it along with the data. If the data for some tables is required then the source must be cataloged first and then profiling can be applied to specific tables.\nCatalog, Profile & Lineage Scans\nOn the Scan Now button the user has the option of running \"Lineage\" scans with \"Catalog\" or the user can also run \"Catalog\", \"Profile\" and \"Lineage\" scans by checking all the checkboxes. Now along with the \"Catalog\" and \"Profile\" scan, the Lineage will also be rendered into the application. Once the user clicks on the Scan button the job will be created for \"Catalog\", \"Profile\" & \"Lineage\".\nUsers can access the information related tothe  scan by clicking on the particular scan name.\nScheduling a Job\nThe above examples of scans are basically on-demand which means the moment the \"Scan\" button is clicked, a job will be created and start running but if there is a scenario in which scans are required to run daily or start from a specific date then scans can be scheduled. On the settings tab of the Data Source, the \"General\" tab contains scanning information, and on clicking \"Edit\", jobs can be scheduled and the user can mention the scan types:\nIt is to be noted that only scan types \"Catalog\", \"Catalog & Profile\", \"Catalog & Lineage\" & \"Catalog, Profile & Lineage\" can be scheduled. The scan type \"Profile\" can not be scheduled for a particular time. On selecting the right scan type, the scan frequency, start, and end time can be selected according to the requirement. Once the information is saved, a job will be scheduled with the scan type that was selected:\nSpecial Cases for Certain Sources\nIn our application, there are some sources that don't have the option of separate \"Catalog\" & \"Profile\" and \"Catalog\" & \"Lineage. For these sources on the \"Scan Now\" button on Data sources, there will be no drop-down appearing asking for selecting scan type. In these sources, the scan type will be \"Catalog & Profile\" or \"Catalog\" & \"Lineage\" by default. These 4 sources are:\nAzure Data Lake Storage (Catalog & Profile scan available)\nPower BI (Catalog & Lineage scan available)\nTableau (Catalog & Lineage scan available)\nFile Upload (Catalog & Profile scan available)",

Login to the salesforce account. Once the login step is complete, it will redirect back to the source detail page and there user will see that the source is authenticated successfully.\nStep 4:\nAfter the credentials are authenticated, we need to save the source. For that, scroll up to the top. From the top right corner click on the “Done” button.\nAfter that click the “Save” button. The source will get saved successfully.\nNote:\nWhen adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source. However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.\nThe connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.\nRunning a Data Scan\nStep 1: Start a Scan\nNavigate to Scan History.\nClick Scan Now.\nA job will be created to fetch data from Salesforce.\nAfter the scan completion, click on Scan Name and it will open the Scan Summary page of this scan.\nStep 2: Review Scan Results\nOnce the scan completes, click on the Scan Name.\nThe Scan Summary page will display:\nNew tables and columns were fetched.\nData insights.\nAfter the scan completion, click on Scan Name and it will open the Scan Summary page of this scan.\nTo explore table details, g\no to the\nDictionaries\ndropdown and select the\nData Dictionary\n→ Recently Refreshed.\nClick on any table name to view details.",

For the PostgreSQL source, we would have a Schema field as well which will contain a checkbox, If we want to scan all the schemas then we shouldn't check this checkbox and proceed with saving and scanning the source. But if we want to limit our scan to some specific schemas then check this checkbox.\nOnce it is checked then the list of available schemas will be displayed. Users can select single or multiple schemas from the Available Schemas list and move them to the Selected Schemas tab on the right.\nStep 4: Save the Connection\nScroll to the top of the page.\nClick Done.\nClick Save.\nThe PostgreSQL source is now configured successfully.\nAfter that click the “Save” button. The source will get saved successfully.\nNote:\nWhen adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source.

The steps provided apply to both DvSum Data Insights (DI) and DvSum Data Quality (DQ), with only minor variations based on the specific platform.\nSetting Up Snowflake for DvSum Integration\nBefore configuring Snowflake in DvSum, a dedicated user and role must be created with the appropriate privileges for metadata access. Additionally, specific account-level grants are required to enable access to\nquery history\nand\ndata lineage\ninformation.\nBefore proceeding with the source configuration in DvSum, follow the steps below to set up Snowflake with the required user, role, and privileges.\nUser and Role Configuration for Metadata Access\n1. Metadata Access Configuration\nTo enable cataloging and profiling in DvSum, a Snowflake user must have access to metadata such as tables and columns. How this access is granted may vary depending on internal Snowflake policies.\nThe script below is a\nsample only\nand can be adapted as needed. It’s not required to run this script as-is — the key requirement is that the user should be able to execute the following test queries successfully.\nTest Queries – Required Metadata Access\nThese queries can be used to confirm that the user has sufficient access to metadata:\n-- * Tables metadata (replace <DATABASE_NAME>)\nSELECT * FROM <DATABASE_NAME>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES ORDER BY created DESC;\n\n-- * Columns metadata (replace <DATABASE_NAME>)\nSELECT * FROM <DATABASE_NAME>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;\nSample Script – User and Role Creation\nIf a suitable user and role are not already available, the following script can be used as a reference to create them with minimal, controlled access. This is one possible approach — feel free to adapt or implement based on your organization’s standards.\nBefore executing the script, update the placeholders (\n<USERNAME>\n,\n<PASSWORD>\n,\n<ROLE_NAME>\n,\n<WAREHOUSE>\n, etc.) with appropriate values for your Snowflake environment.\n-- =====================================================\n-- Snowflake Script: Create User\n-- Purpose: Create user with minimal privileges for metadata access\n-- =====================================================\n\n-- Configuration placeholders - Update these values\n-- SET username = '<USERNAME>';\n-- SET password = '<PASSWORD>'; \n-- SET role_name = '<ROLE_NAME>';\n-- SET warehouse = '<WAREHOUSE>';\n\n-- =====================================================\n-- SECTION 1: USER CREATION\n-- =====================================================\n-- * Create user with secure defaults\nCREATE USER <USERNAME>\nPASSWORD = '<PASSWORD>'\nDEFAULT_ROLE = '<ROLE_NAME>'\nDEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = '<WAREHOUSE>'\nCOMMENT = 'User for reading metadata and query history';\n\n-- =====================================================\n-- SECTION 2: ROLE CREATION AND ASSIGNMENT\n-- =====================================================\n-- * Create custom role with minimal privileges\nCREATE ROLE <ROLE_NAME>\nCOMMENT = 'Role for accessing metadata and query history with minimal privileges';\n\n-- * Assign role to user\nGRANT ROLE <ROLE_NAME> TO USER <USERNAME>;\n\n-- =====================================================\n-- SECTION 3: WAREHOUSE ACCESS\n-- =====================================================\n-- * Grant warehouse usage for metadata queries\nGRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE <WAREHOUSE> TO ROLE <ROLE_NAME>;\n\n-- =====================================================\n-- SECTION 4: DATABASE AND SCHEMA ACCESS\n-- =====================================================\n-- * Grant USAGE on all databases for INFORMATION_SCHEMA access\nGRANT USAGE ON ALL DATABASES IN ACCOUNT TO ROLE <ROLE_NAME>;\nGRANT USAGE ON ALL SCHEMAS IN ACCOUNT TO ROLE <ROLE_NAME>;\n\n-- * Grant USAGE on future databases and schemas\nGRANT USAGE ON FUTURE DATABASES IN ACCOUNT TO ROLE <ROLE_NAME>;\nGRANT USAGE ON FUTURE SCHEMAS IN ACCOUNT TO ROLE <ROLE_NAME>;\n\n-- * Tables metadata (replace <DATABASE_NAME>)\n/*\nSELECT * FROM <DATABASE_NAME>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES ORDER BY created DESC;\n*/\n\n-- * Columns metadata (replace <DATABASE_NAME>)\n/*\nSELECT * FROM <DATABASE_NAME>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;\n*/\n2. Lineage Access Configuration\nTo enable query history and lineage extraction in DvSum, the user must have access to Snowflake’s\nACCOUNT_USAGE\nviews and the appropriate privileges.\nAs with the previous section, the\ngoal\nis for the user to be able to successfully run the test queries below. If that works, lineage-related access is correctly configured. The grants script provided afterward is a\nreference\n, not a requirement to follow exactly.\nTest Queries – Required for Lineage Extraction\n-- * Query history (all users, last 30 days)\nSELECT *\nFROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history\nWHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())\nORDER BY start_time DESC;\n\n-- * Views metadata\nSELECT * FROM snowflake.account_usage.views WHERE deleted IS NULL;\n\n-- * Functions metadata\nSELECT * FROM snowflake.account_usage.functions WHERE deleted IS NULL;\n\n-- * Stored procedures metadata\nSELECT * FROM snowflake.account_usage.procedures WHERE deleted IS NULL;\nSample Grants Script – Lineage Access\nThe following script is intended as a reference to help grant the minimum required privileges for enabling query history and lineage features in DvSum.\nIf your existing setup already supports the test queries mentioned earlier, you may skip this step.\nOtherwise, use this script as a baseline and adapt it to align with your internal roles, naming conventions, and security policies.\n-- * Switch to ACCOUNTADMIN for account-level privileges\nUSE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;\n\n-- ===========================================================\n-- SECTION 5: ACCOUNT-LEVEL PRIVILEGES FOR LINEAGE METADATA\n-- ===========================================================\n-- * Grant MONITOR privilege for query history access across all users\nGRANT MONITOR ON ACCOUNT TO ROLE <ROLE_NAME>;\n\n-- * Grant access to SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE views\nGRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE <ROLE_NAME>;\n\n-- =====================================================\n-- SECTION 6: VERIFICATION QUERIES\n-- =====================================================\n-- * Query history (all users, last 30 days)\nSELECT *\nFROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history \nWHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())\nORDER BY start_time DESC;\n\n-- * Views metadata \nSELECT * FROM snowflake.account_usage.views WHERE deleted IS NULL;\n\n-- * Functions metadata\nSELECT * FROM snowflake.account_usage.functions WHERE deleted IS NULL;\n\n-- * Stored procedures metadata\nSELECT * FROM snowflake.account_usage.procedures WHERE deleted IS NULL;\nSteps to Configure Snowflake as a Source\nStep 1: Add Snowflake as a Source\nGo to the Administration dropdown and select the\nData Sources\ntab.\nClick the\nAdd Source\nbutton.\nIn the modal that appears:\nSelect\nSnowflake\nas the data source.\nProvide a meaningful\nSource Name\n.\nClick\nSave\n.\nStep 2: Configure Connection Settings\nAfter saving, you will be redirected to the\nConnection Settings\npage.\nEnable the checkbox for\nOn-premise Web Service\n(if applicable).\nSelect the\nSAWS\n(Secure Agent Web Service) that is set up and currently running.\nEnter the required connection details:\nURL\nWarehouse\nDatabase Login\nPassword\nClick\nAuthenticate\nto validate the connection.\nNote\n: By Default the SAWS type will be cloud.

By adding Power BI as a source, you can scan reports and datasets, making them available for documentation, curation, and tracking lineage from their originating data sources.\nPrerequisites\nBefore proceeding, ensure you have the following:\nA valid Power BI account with appropriate permissions.\nThe Client ID, Client Secret, and Tenant ID for your Power BI application.\nAccess to the Power BI API for seamless integration.\nA DvSum account with access to Data Catalog (DC) or Data Quality (DQ).\nStep-by-Step Configuration\n1. Confirm Availability of Datasets and Reports\nLog in to your Power BI account.\nEnsure that reports and datasets are available and accessible based on your user permissions.\n2. Add Power BI as a Source in DvSum\nLog into DvSum Data Catalog (DC).\nNavigate to\nAdministration\n→\nData Sources\n→\nAdd Source\n.\nIn the pop-up window:\nSelect\nPower BI\nas the source.\nProvide a\nSource Name\n.\nClick\nSave\n.\n3. Configure Connection Settings\nOnce a new Power BI source is created, you will be redirected to the connection settings detail page of the new source. In the Credentials section in Connection settings, enter these three properties:\nClient ID\nClient Secret\nTenant ID\nAfter entering the credentials, authenticate the source.\nOnce the source is authenticated, a\n\"Workspaces\"\nsection will appear below the Authenticate button. By default, all workspaces will be scanned.\nTo limit the scan to specific workspaces, check the\n\"Limit to specific workspaces\"\noption. This will enable two tabs:\n\"Available Workspaces\"\nand\n\"Selected Workspaces\"\n, allowing you to choose which workspaces to include in the scan. You can also choose whether to\ninclude personal workspaces\nby selecting the corresponding checkbox.\nIf \"Limit to specific workspaces\" is checked, the workspaces will be listed in the “Available Workspaces” tab. Select workspaces that are to be scanned, and move them to the “Selected Schemas” tab.\n4. Save the Connection\nTo save, scroll up to the top. From the top right corner click on the “Done” button.\nAfter that click the “Save” button. The source will get saved successfully.\nNote:\nWhen adding or editing a Data Source, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, it will still allows to save the Data Source. However, authentication will fail, and the Data Source will be marked as unusable with a red icon. The Data Source will not be usable until the correct credentials are provided.\nThe connection is saved, but it cannot be used until valid authentication details are updated.\n5. Scan the Data Source\nNavigate to the\nScan History Page\n.\nClick\nScan Now\nto initiate the scan.\nOnce completed, the status will change to\nCompleted\n.\nClick on the\nScan Name\nto open the Scan Summary page.\nThe summary will show the number of reports and datasets fetched.\nNavigate to Scan History Page and click the \"Scan Now\" button. When the scan is complete, the status will change to \"Completed\".\nAfter the scan completes, click on Scan Name and it will open the Scan Summary page of this scan.\nThe Scan Summary page displays all the insights of the scan. It indicates how many new workbooks and datasets were found in the scan. In the screenshot below it shows that 9 Reports and 5 Datasets were found.\nYour Power BI connection is now fully configured and functional.\nBrowsing the Data Catalog\nSemantic Models\nNow, let’s analyze the semantic models that we got from this scan. Navigate to the Assets Dictionary on the left sidebar and apply the asset type filter \"BI Semantic Model\". You will be able to see all the semantic models. From there, go to the  \"Recently Refreshed\" tab and select the semantic models that we have got in the recent scan.x\nThe Semantic Model can further have BI Tables if they were created in it, and the list of BI tables can be seen on the detail page of the Semantic Model:\nThe BI table detail page has an \"Overview\" tab, which contains all the properties of the BI tables, and a \"Data\" tab, which will contain the BI fields of the Table. Users can also see the lineage on BI Table if it exists:\nReports\nFrom the BI Reports listing, select a recently scanned Report, and the user will be redirected to the detail page of the Report. The screenshot below shows what the Reports detail page looks like.\nPlease note that only BI Reports have a separate listing page; for other BI assets, users will have to go to the Assets dictionary and apply the asset type filter\nOn the detail page, a description of the report is fetched from the Power BI report. This means this report has the same description in Power BI, and the same description is fetched and shows up here. The author of the report is basically the person who created this report in Power BI, so this value is also basically fetched. Further, we have a lineage of the Report, which actually shows us that the current Report is derived from which data set and which tables are connected to that data set.\nDashboards\nFrom the Assets dictionary listing, users can apply the asset type filter \"BI Dashboard,\" and all the dashboards (if there were any) can be seen on the listing page. The screenshot below shows what the dashboard detail page looks like:\nTroubleshooting Tips\nIf the test connection fails, confirm that prerequisites are complete and API validation has been performed (see\n[Configure Microsoft Power BI Permissions]\n).\nEnsure the Client Secret is valid and not expired.\nVerify that metadata scanning is enabled in Power BI.\nVideo Tutorial\nWatch this quick video tutorial on how to add and configure a Power BI source into DvSum app.\nNext Steps\nFor setting up permissions in Power BI:\n[\nConfigure Microsoft Power BI Permissions\n]\nAdditional Resources\nRead more about\nDvSum Web Service (Cloud SAWS)\nRead more about\nDvSum Edge Gateway (On-Premises SAWS)",

It provides analogous functionality to the on-premises gateway (sometimes referred to as SAWS), but it eliminates the need for users to install the connector locally on their machines. The DvSum Web Service enables users to establish connections with various online sources, such as APIs, databases, or services, without the burden of setting up and managing local installations.\nBy leveraging the DvSum Web Service, users can access and interact with online sources directly, streamlining the process of retrieving data or integrating with external systems. The connector is hosted in the cloud, offering convenience, scalability, and ease of use for users. They can utilize Cloud SAWS to securely connect to authorized online sources, leveraging its capabilities to fetch data, make requests, or perform desired actions without the need for local installation.\nDvSum connects to data sources using one of these:\nDvSum Web Service\nOn-Premises Gateway\nIn this article, we will be covering the process through which a source can be connected using the DvSum Web Service and how this compares to using an on-premises gateway.\nBy default when any source is added, it will be connected using the DvSum Web Service, so there is no extra step required for connection. But if the user chooses to authenticate using the on-premises gateway then they will need to enable the checkbox of On-premises Web Service.\nFor Configuring of Data Source (Snowflake) using On-Premises Local Saws, click\nhere\nIP Whitelisting:\nFor the Sources in which any Inbound Connection is not allowed or requires VPN for the connection to be made will be required to whitelist the given IP address in order to authenticate the credentials for that source. Currently, there are two sources for which IP whitelisting will be required:\nMicrosoft SQL Server\nOracle (Host selected as \"qasaws.dvsum.com\")\nOnce the IP address is whitelisted the network firewall will allow the particular connector to be able to connect with that particular source.\nBefore IP whitelisting\nAfter IP whitelisting\nNote\n: For whitelisting, users will be required to whitelist the DvSum IP where the organization's data source has been hosted. Admin of that source will be authorized to do that.\nAfter Successful Authentication, the user can choose any database and save the changes and scan that particular source to bring in the tables:\nAdvantages Over Local On-Premises SAWS\nNo Prior Installations Required:\nIn the case of Local On-premises SAWS, it should be locally installed and running but in the case of Cloud SAWS, no installation is required.\nMuch Faster than Local On-Premises SAWS:\nScans that run on Cloud SAWS take less time as compared to the scan when it is run using the local on-premises SAWS.",

They act as independent identities for scripts or background processes accessing DvSum APIs.\nScope\nSelect which APIs the client should have access to:\nAll Scopes\n– grants access to all APIs.\nSpecific Scopes\n– grant access only to selected APIs.\nAccess Level\n:\nRead\naccess is enabled by default.\nWrite\naccess can be enabled where applicable (e.g., Asset Listing).\nConfigure Alerts\nIn the\nAlert\ntab, you can configure notifications to be sent when credentials are about to expire.\nInternal Recipients\n:\nSelect from available\nGroups\nor\nUsers\nand move them to the\nSelected\nlist.\nThe OAuth client creator is automatically added by default.\nExternal Recipients\n:\nEnter comma-separated emails (e.g.,\nexample@email.com\n).\nOnly emails from\nwhitelisted domains\nare allowed.\nExpiry Alerts\n: Expiration alerts are sent\n3 days before credential expiry\n, then repeated daily until credentials are refreshed or rotated.\nGenerate and Store Credentials\nReview all settings.\nClick\nSave\nto generate the\nClient ID\nand\nClient Secret\nfor authentication.\nImportant:\nCredentials can only be viewed once. After closing the modal, they cannot be retrieved again.\nDownload and store them securely (e.g., password manager or encrypted vault).\nThe downloaded CSV file contains both the Client ID and Client Secret, as shown below.\nRotate API Credentials\nIf credentials are compromised or nearing expiry, you can\nrotate\nthem.\nClick the\nMore Options (⋮)\nmenu for the client.\nSelect\nRotate\n.\nConfirm Rotation\nA message will confirm that new credentials will be generated.\nOld credentials remain valid for\n24 hours\n, giving time to update integrations.\nAfter 24 hours, old keys are automatically disabled.\nDownload New Credentials\nOnce rotated, new credentials are issued.\nCopy or download them immediately — they cannot be viewed again after closing.\nNote:\nRemember to update all applications and services with the\nnew Client ID/Secret\nbefore the old ones expire.\nDelete API Clients\nYou can delete one or multiple OAuth2 clients if they are no longer required. Deletion immediately revokes access for the associated Client ID and Secret.\nDelete an Individual Client\nClick the\nMore Options (⋮)\nmenu next to the client.\nSelect\nDelete\n.\nConfirm the deletion.\nBulk Delete Multiple Clients\nUse the\nmain checkbox\nat the top of the OAuth2 client list to select all displayed clients, or select individual checkboxes for multiple clients.\nOnce selected, the\nDelete\noption will appear at the top of the list.\nClick\nDelete\nand confirm to remove all selected clients.\nNote:\nDeleting an OAuth2 client is irreversible. Any applications or integrations using the deleted credentials will immediately lose access. If access is still required, create a new client and update your systems with the new credentials.\nView Assigned APIs\nOn the\nManage OAuth2 Clients\npage, the\nResources\ncolumn shows how many APIs are assigned to each client.\nClicking the API count (e.g.,\n“6 APIs”\n) opens a detailed view of the assigned scopes.\nThe detailed view lists all APIs granted to the client, along with their\naccess levels\n(Read, Write, Delete).\nThis helps administrators quickly verify which endpoints each client can access and adjust scope if needed.\nSummary of Service-Based Authentication\nUse the generated credentials to authenticate via\nOAuth2 Client Credentials flow\n.\nRefer to the\nAPI documentation\nfor details on endpoints, request formats, and sample payloads.\nUser Role–Based API Access\nIn addition to service-based authentication clients, DvSum also supports\nuser role–based credentials\n. This allows administrators to enable API access tied directly to a user’s role.\nEnable API Access for a Role\nNavigate to\nAdministration → User Management → User Roles\n.\nEither add a new role or edit an existing one.\nGo to the\nAPI Access\ntab.\nSelect\nEnable API Access\n.\nConfigure Role-Based API Access\nSet a\nSecret Rotation Interval\n(e.g., 180 days) or choose\nNever Expires\n(not recommended).\nSelect the\nAPIs\nthis role should have access to.\nBy default, any APIs already available to the role in the UI are pre-selected.\nAdditional APIs can be enabled as needed.\nSave the configuration.\nGenerate and Manage User Credentials\nOnce API access is enabled for a role:\nUsers assigned to that role will see a new\nAPI Credentials\ntab under\nMy Settings\n.\nFrom there, each user can:\nGenerate\ntheir own Client ID and Secret.\nRotate\ntheir credentials when needed.\nDelete\ntheir credentials if they are no longer required.\nNotes:\nThe\nexpiry interval\nis set at the role level by administrators. All users in that role inherit the same expiry.\nUsers\ncannot change expiry\n, but they can generate, rotate, and delete their own credentials.\nThe API access scope always reflects the permissions granted to the user role. If role permissions change, the user access changes automatically.\nOnce generated, users authenticate using the same flow as service-based clients: generate an\naccess token\nvia the Authentication API and use it in subsequent API calls.\nAPI Credentials Tab Availability\nBy default, the\nAPI Credentials\noption under\nMy Settings\nwill appear\ngreyed out\nfor users.\nTo activate this tab, the user must be part of a\nUser Group\nthat is assigned to a\nUser Role with API Access enabled\n.\nAPI Credentials disabled before Role Assignment:\nAPI Credentials Enabled after Role Assignment:\nManage Generated Credentials\nOnce the\nAPI Credentials\ntab is active and the user generates their credentials:\nDownload\n: Just like with service-based clients, credentials must be\ndownloaded immediately\n. They cannot be viewed again once the modal is closed.\nRotate\n: Users can rotate their own credentials to issue a new secret. The old secret remains valid for 24 hours, after which it is automatically disabled.\nDelete\n: Users can delete their credentials if they are no longer required. A new set can be generated at any time as long as their role has API access enabled.\nNote:\nRotation and deletion are managed at the\nuser level\n, but\nexpiry\nis controlled by the\nrole configuration\nset by administrators.\nUsing API Documentation & Authentication Flow\nAll available DvSum APIs are listed in the official API documentation:\nDvSum API Documentation\nYou can download the collection from this site and import it into\nPostman\nor another API client.\nBefore You Begin (Pre-requisites)\nBefore running the authentication request, make sure you have the following set up in\nPostman\n:\nCreate an Environment (if not already set):\nGo to the\nEnvironments\ntab in Postman and create a new environment.\nAdd a variable named\nauthUrl\nwith the value:\nauth.dvsum.ai\nClick\nSet active\nto activate the environment.\nSet up Headers for Authentication:\nIn the\nHeaders\ntab of your authentication request (\n/oauth2/token\n), ensure the following keys and values are added:\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded \nAccept: application/json \nAuthorization: Basic <base64_encoded_clientid_secret>\nOnce these pre-requisites are complete, proceed with\nStep 1: Authenticate with Client Credentials\nas described below.\nStep 1: Authenticate with Client Credentials\nUse the\nClient ID\nand\nClient Secret\nyou generated earlier to obtain an\naccess token\n.\nOpen the\nAuthentication API\n(first in the documentation).\nCombine your Client ID and Secret in the format:\nclient_id:client_secret\nConvert this string into\nBase64 encoding\nOnce generated,\ncopy the encoded value\nand\npaste it into the Authorization header\nin Postman as shown below:\nAuthorization: Basic <base64_encoded_clientid_secret>\nWhen you send the request, the API will return an\naccess token\n.\nStep 2: Use the Access Token\nThe access token is a\nBearer token\nvalid for\n1 hour\n.\nCopy this token and include it in the header for all subsequent API requests:\nAuthorization: Bearer <your_access_token>\nStep 3: Run an API Example\nOnce you have an access token, you can use it to call APIs that your client/role has access to.\nExample request:\nGET {{baseUrl}}/node-listing/gov-view?node_type=TBL&node_id=40837560\nHeaders:\nAccept\n:\napplication/json\nAuthorization\n:\nBearer <your_access_token>\nRunning\nGet Governance Views\nAPI in Postman:\nA successful call returns\n200 OK\nwith the response payload.\nImportant Notes\nAccess is restricted to the APIs that were explicitly granted in the\nScope\ntab when creating the client.\nTokens must be refreshed every hour using the same authentication API.\nTip:\nImport the full Postman collection from the\nDvSum API Documentation\nfor comprehensive examples of all available APIs.",

    "content": "In This Article:\nOverview\nDefining a Custom Asset Type\nCustomizing the Asset Type\nConfiguring Relationships for an Asset Type\nAdding a Custom Asset\nEditing and Enriching the Asset\nOverview\nThe DvSum DI Application supports\nCustom Assets\n, allowing organizations to define and manage asset types that align with their unique data landscape. This capability enables teams to create asset categories tailored to specific governance frameworks, business processes, and domain requirements.\nCustom Assets are fully integrated into the DvSum platform—they appear in the asset feed, support Custom Attributes, and participate in workflows, lineage, and search. This ensures a flexible and consistent metadata experience across the catalog.\nDefining a Custom Asset Type\nBefore creating a Custom Asset, the asset type must be defined. To do this:\nNavigate to the\nAsset Management\nsection from the left-side menu.\nClick on\nAsset Types\n.\nClick the\nAdd\nbutton at the top right.\nOn the listing page, a predefined set of default asset types is displayed. These system-provided assets are visible even if no custom assets have been added. Any newly created custom assets will appear alongside these default entries.\nThis opens the\nAdd Asset Type\npop-up.\nEnter the required details for the new asset type.\nClick\nAdd\nto save.\nCustomizing the Asset Type\nOnce the asset type is created, the\nAsset Type Detail\npage is displayed. This page acts as a\ntemplate\nfor all assets created using this type. Any configurations made here—such as custom attributes, tags, or relationships—will automatically apply to all assets of this type. Changes made to the asset type template will reflect across all associated assets.\nAdd or edit\nCustom Attributes\nDefine\nTags\nSet up\nRelationships\nwith other asset types\nThese configurations allow you to enrich your custom asset with relevant metadata, improving its discoverability, traceability, and integration within workflows.\nConfiguring Relationships for an Asset Type\nAs part of configuring a custom asset type, you can define how it relates to other assets in the system using the\nRelationships\nsection.\nNavigate to the\nRelationships\ntab on the asset type detail page.\nYou can\nadd multiple relationship types\n, each with a:\nRelationship Type Name\n(e.g., Contains, Governed By)\nTarget Asset Type\n(e.g., BI Model and Report, Data Domain)\nEach relationship type includes a checkbox that allows you to\nenable or disable multi-asset linking\n.\nEnable this option to define relationships that support linking multiple assets of the selected type. For example, allowing an asset to be related to several database tables.\nYou can also remove a relationship type using the\ntrash can icon\nunder the Actions column.\nAdding a Custom Asset\nOnce your custom asset type is configured, you can begin adding assets to the system.\nSteps to Add a Custom Asset:\nNavigate to the Assets Dictionary\nFrom the\nleft-side navigation menu\n, click on\nAssets Dictionary\n.\nClick on \"Add Asset\"\nIn the\nAll Assets\nsection, click the green\nAdd Asset\nbutton at the top right.\nThis will open a form where you can enter details for the new asset, including selecting the appropriate\nAsset Type\n, filling in standard and custom attributes, and establishing relationships.\nEditing and Enriching the Asset\nAfter adding a new asset, you’ll be directed to the\nAsset Detail Page\n, where you can view and manage all the metadata associated with the asset.\nThe configurations made on the\nAsset Type Detail Page\n—such as\nCustom Attributes\n,\nTags\n, and\nRelationships\n—are automatically applied to the asset. From here, you can:\nEdit or update custom attributes\n(e.g., URLs, rich text fields)\nAdd additional relationships\nto link the asset with other entities\nDelete existing relationships\nif they are no longer relevant\nAssign or update ownership\nvia the\nManaged By\nsection (e.g., Data Owner, Data Steward)\nAdd or modify tags\nlike Data Classification, Certification, or Dataset Quality\nInclude additional information\nsuch as descriptions, data domains, and other contextual metadata",

Previously, asset attributes were limited to a predefined set of fields. With this enhancement, users can define and manage their own attributes, improving flexibility, governance, and contextual relevance across all asset types.\nCustom Attributes can be created for various asset categories such as databases, schemas, reports, models, and more. These attributes appear alongside standard fields in the asset detail pages and can be used to enrich asset metadata, support workflows, and enhance discoverability.\nAccessing Custom Attributes\nTo manage Custom Attributes in the DvSum DI Application:\nNavigate to the\nAdministration\nfrom the left-side menu\nClick on\nAsset Management -> Custom Attributes\n.\nThis page displays a list of all defined attributes with details such as:\nAttribute Label\nType (e.g., Date, Checkbox, URL, Pick List)\nApply To Asset Types\nUsage Count\nModified By\nModified On\nEnabled (On/Off)\nAdding Custom Attributes\nTo add a new Custom Attribute:\nOn the\nCustom Attributes\npage, click the green\nAdd\nbutton at the top right.\nA pop-up window titled\nAdd Attribute\nwill appear.\nFill in the following fields:\nType\n(Required)\n– Choose from the dropdown list:\nCheckbox\nDate\nDate Time\nNumber\nPick List\nRich Text\nMark Down\nSingle Line Text\nUpload\nURL\nLabel\n(Required)\n– Enter a name for the attribute.\nDescription\n(Optional)\n– Add any notes or context for the attribute.\nClick\nAdd\nto save the attribute or\nCancel\nto discard.\nCustom Attributes are\nreusable\nand can be applied across\nmultiple asset types\n, enabling consistent metadata enrichment and governance.\nAttribute Detail Page\nAfter the attribute is added, a detail page is displayed to complete the setup. This page is divided into two sections:\nBasic Configuration\nThis section displays the core details of the attribute, including type, label, and description. An option is available to enable a tooltip, which will appear on asset detail pages to provide additional context.\nAttribute Configuration\nThis section allows further customization of the attribute. Configuration options include validation rules, default values, mandatory status, and multi-value support. A checklist is provided to specify which asset types the attribute should apply to, ensuring relevance and consistency across the catalog.\nThe\nShow Tooltip\ncheckbox enables a tooltip to be displayed on asset detail pages. When hovered, the attribute’s description will appear as a tooltip, providing users with quick contextual information without needing to open the full attribute details.\nAttribute Configuration Options\nThe Attribute Configuration screen includes several checkboxes that define how the custom attribute behaves across assets:\nMandatory\nWhen enabled, this setting ensures that a value must be provided for the attribute. It enforces data completeness by preventing asset creation or updates without a valid entry.\nAllow Multiple Values\nThis option allows the attribute to accept more than one value. It is useful for cases where an asset may be associated with multiple tags, categories, or other multi-select metadata.\nFine-Grained Control (Apply To Asset Types)\nEnabling this checkbox allows attribute behavior—such as mandatory status and default values—to be customized per asset type. This overrides global settings and provides more granular governance across different asset categories.\nUpdating Custom Attribute Values via import\nCustom attribute values can be added or updated for the assets to which the attributes are applied. To update custom attribute values in bulk, first add the custom attribute column to a custom view for the relevant asset type and then download that view. The downloaded Excel template will automatically include all custom attributes applied to the assets.\nNote:\nData Import feature can be used to add or update values for custom attributes, the custom attributes themselves cannot be imported.\nFor more information on using the Data Import feature, refer\nData Import\narticle.\nInput Patterns for Validation\nFor attribute types such as\nURL\n,\nNumber\n, and\nDate\n, input patterns can be defined to enforce structured data entry. The\nAttribute Validation\nsection provides a dropdown with predefined patterns, and also includes an option to create a custom pattern.\nClicking on\nCreate a Custom Pattern\nopens a configuration form where a new pattern can be defined using regular expressions. The form includes fields for pattern name, regex, description, and sample values to illustrate expected input formats.\nNote\n:\nThe regular expressions used in custom attribute validation follow the\nECMAScript (JavaScript) regex standard\n, which is natively supported by modern browsers. This allows you to use familiar JavaScript-style regex patterns for creating flexible and intuitive validations.\nThis flexibility allows organizations to tailor validation rules to match specific formatting requirements and ensure consistent data quality across assets.\nAttribute Visibility Control\nThe\nCustom Attributes\npage includes options to manage attribute visibility and lifecycle. Attributes can be toggled between\nActive\nand\nInactive\nusing the\nAttribute Visibility\ndropdown. This allows administrators to control which attributes are available for use without permanently deleting them.\nVisibility can be managed in multiple ways:\nMass Update\n– Multiple attributes can be selected and updated in bulk using the visibility dropdown.\nSingle Attribute Toggle\n– Individual attributes can be activated or deactivated directly from the listing.\nWithin Attribute Detail Page\n– Visibility settings can also be adjusted from within the attribute’s configuration screen.",

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to trigger jobs, check execution status, and handle API responses efficiently.\nEach job can run in one of two distinct modes: it can either be scheduled to run at predetermined times or triggered via an API for on-demand execution. However, only one method can be active at a time; jobs cannot operate as both scheduled and API-triggered simultaneously. The mode of execution should be chosen based on specific requirements to ensure consistent operation under a single, exclusive mode.\nFor more details on how to create a job, refer to the\nCreating\na\nNew\nJob\narticle.\nPrerequisites\nBefore executing a job via API, ensure you have the following:\nA Job:\nThe job must be configured for API execution (it cannot be scheduled).\nOAuth Client Credentials:\nYou can create an OAuth2 Client from the Application Security tab and use the Client ID and Secret or enable API Access at the User Role level.\nAccess Token:\nUsing the above OAuth credentials, generate an access token through the Authentication API mentioned in the\nAPI Documentation.\nRefer to the article\n‘\nDvSum API Access and Authentication Management\n’\nfor details on creating an authentication client and generating access tokens.\nAPI Endpoints for Job Execution\n1.

Generate a new token using your Client ID and Secret when it expires.\nStep 1: Configure the Job for API Execution\nNavigate to the\nSchedule\ntab in the DvSum platform.\nSelect the schedule type as\nExecute via API\n.\nFor detailed instructions, refer to the\nCreating\na\nJob\narticle.\nStep 2: Generate API URLs\nClick on\nGenerate API URL\n. This will generate both the POST and GET request URLs needed for API execution.\nExamples of Job Execution via API\nTo facilitate job execution via API in DvSum, three main approaches are available: manual execution, using Postman, and script automation. Each method provides options for managing job execution and monitoring through the API, with step-by-step instructions provided for each option below. The approach can be selected based on workflow and technical requirements.\nManual Execution\nThis section covers the process for manually executing jobs via API. If you prefer direct control over job execution, follow this step-by-step guide.\nStep-by-Step Guide to Executing Jobs via API\nStep 1: Execute the Job\ncurl -X POST\nhttps://apis.dvsum.ai/integration/jobs/[job_id/execute\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer <access_token>\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\nCopy the POST request URL and paste it into your command prompt or API client (e.g., Postman).\nRun the command to execute the job:\nPOST\n\"https://apis.dvsum.ai/integration/jobs/[job_id]/execute\"\nStep 2: Retrieve Execution Details\ncurl -X GET\nhttps://apis.dvsum.ai/integration/jobs/[execution_id]/details\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer <access_token>\"\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\\\nAfter executing the job, copy the GET request URL and paste it into your command prompt or API client.\nReplace the following placeholders:\n[execution_id]\nwith the execution ID from the POST request.\n[<access_token>]\nwith your valid access token obtained using OAuth Client credentials or User Role based credentials\nRun the GET request to retrieve job execution details:\nGET\n\"https://apis.dvsum.ai/integration/jobs/[execution_id]/details\"\nStep 3: View Execution Details\nThe GET request will display the status and other details of the job execution once completed.\nStep 4: Fetch Exception Records\nCase1:\nOn-prem Gateway\nFor an on-prem gateway, exception records can be downloaded, and the requested URL can be accessed using the provided\nx-api-key\nin the response.\nCase 2:\nCloud Gateway\nFor a cloud gateway, exception records can be downloaded using the\npre-signed URL\nprovided in the response.\nNote:\nException records can only be downloaded up to a limit of\n10,000 records\n.\nUsing Postman\nEnhance the process by importing the API requests into Postman for more structured testing. This method allows you to interact with the API and automate requests efficiently visually.\nCalling API Endpoints for Job Execution\n1. Execute Job (POST Request)\nThis endpoint triggers the execution of a job.\nEndpoint:\nPOST\nhttps://apis.dvsum.ai/integration/jobs/[job_id]/execute\n2. Retrieve Execution Details (GET Request)\nThis endpoint retrieves the status and details of the job execution.\nEndpoint:\nGET\nhttps://apis.dvsum.ai/integration/jobs/[execution_id]/details\n3. View Execution Details\nThe provided download request URL in the execution details can be used to view the execution details.\nScript Automation\nAutomate job execution by using a script. This method is ideal for users who want to integrate the API into their workflow. Sample scripts can be provided for reference to help automate repetitive tasks.",

This policy ensures that sensitive table data is hidden from users who should not have access to it. Once access to a table is revoked, associated column data and rule-level exception data are also automatically restricted.\nThis functionality helps safeguard sensitive data and streamlines the user experience by ensuring that each user role only interacts with data they are permitted to view.\nAccessing and Applying the Data Exclusion Policy\nTo configure a new Data Exclusion Policy:\nNavigate to:\nAdministration → Account → User Security\nScroll to the\nSample Data Exclusion Policy\nsection.\nClick\nAdd Exclusion Policy\n.\nFill in the Required Information:\nPolicy Name:\nSpecify a unique and identifiable name for the policy.\nRole:\nSelect the role to which this policy will apply.\nUsers can then configure criteria by selecting specific columns. Multiple condition types are available, allowing flexible and targeted policy setup based on the selected column values.\nNote:\nThe data will be hidden only for users assigned to the role(s) selected while creating the policy.\nUsers with all other roles will continue to view the data without any restriction.\nManaging Exclusion Policies\nAdministrators can manage existing exclusion policies through the following actions:\nBulk Actions\nSelect multiple policies to update visibility settings or delete them in one go.\nEdit/Delete\nClick the\nellipsis (⋯)\nnext to a policy to make changes or remove it.\nActivate/Deactivate\nUse the\ntoggle switch\nto enable or disable a policy without permanently deleting it.\nVisual Examples: How Exclusion Affects Views\n1. Data Dictionary – Column View\nBefore Adding the Role in the Exclusion Policy:\nAll users can view every column and its metadata in the Grid View. Showing all the metadata inside the Column.\nAfter Adding the Role in the Exclusion Policy:\nColumn data will be completely hidden from users assigned to restricted roles.\nIf you select the Dictionary view and click on any column name to view the\nColumn Reference\npage, the visual distribution will no longer be visible. Instead, a message will be displayed stating that the information is restricted due to the applied policy.\n2. Data Quality (DQ) Dictionary – Profiling Tab View\nBefore Adding the Role in the Exclusion Policy:\nOn the\nRules Detail\npage, Exception data from all rules are visible to the users.\nAfter Adding the Role in the Exclusion Policy:\nAll the exception data of the rules will be hidden from users with restricted roles.\nImportant:\nEven if a user is part of a role covered by the exclusion policy, they can still access exception data for rules they own.\nExample:\nIn this case, the user\nAmulya\nbelongs to a role restricted by the exclusion policy. However, because she is the owner of the rule, she retains access to its exception data.\nThe rule that Amulya owns:\nThe rule that Amulya does not own:\n3. Restricting the data view by Data Domain.\nWhen a criteria condition is applied to a Data Domain to limit view access, all datasets within that domain will have their column-level details hidden in the Data tab, restricting users from viewing individual columns.\n4. Restricting the data view by Source\nSource-level restrictions limit access to column details in the Data tab. This control applies uniformly across all datasets linked to that source, supporting consistent data governance and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n5. Restricting the data view by Databases:\nWhen a criteria condition is applied to a database, profiling and exception details are restricted across all related databases as per the exclusion policy. This cascading restriction plays a key role in maintaining data governance and security.",

Classification tags can trigger privacy actions such as masking and column hiding, all of which are configurable by Data Security Admins.\nThis article explains how data classification tags are created, applied, and managed within DvSum. It covers who can assign or modify tags, how roles affect permissions, and how classification levels drive masking and other privacy-related actions.\nTagset\nClassification tags are centrally managed in DvSum by administrative users. These tags are customizable and typically include:\nPublic\nInternal\nSensitive\nRestricted\nAccessing the Tagsets:\nNavigate to\nAdministration.\nGo to\nAsset Management.\nClick on\nTags.\nSelect the\nData Classification\ntagset.\nWithin the Data Classification tagset, users have the ability to create new tags. By default, these tags are assigned a low severity level and cannot be linked to columns or terms that carry a higher sensitivity classification (e.g., Sensitive or Restricted).\nThese classification tags can be applied to both\ncolumns\nand\nterms\n.\nApplying Classification Tags\nFor Columns (Field Dictionary)\nNavigate to the\nDictionaries >\nDatabase Columns.\nSelect the desired column(s).\nOpen the\nMore Actions\ndropdown.\nClick on\nData Classification\n.\nFor Terms (Business Glossary)\nGo to the\nDictionaries >\nGlossary Terms.\nSelect the desired term(s).\nOpen the\nMore Actions\ndropdown.\nClick on\nData Classification\n.\nRoles and Permissions: Data Security Admin vs General Users\nData Security Admin\nFull access to assign, elevate, or downgrade the sensitivity of classification tags.\nCan configure masking, hiding, and other privacy actions for each tag.\nGeneral Users\nCan increase the sensitivity level of a tag (e.g., from\nInternal\nto\nSensitive\n).\nCannot downgrade the classification level.\nIf they attempt to lower the sensitivity, a warning message is displayed, as shown in the screenshot below.\nUpgrade and Downgrade Rules\nData Security Admin\nCan\nupgrade\nclassification tags in all scenarios.\nCan\ndowngrade a column\nonly if\nall linked terms have equal or lower severity\n.\nFor example: If a column is tagged as Sensitive, and all its linked terms are Internal, the column can be downgraded to Internal.\nCan\ndowngrade a term\nonly if\nall linked columns have equal or lower severity\n.\nFor example: If a term is tagged as Restricted, and all its linked columns are Internal, the term can be downgraded to Internal.\nGeneral Users\nCan\nupgrade\nclassification levels freely.\nCannot\ndowngrade\nclassification tags under any condition.\nIf the severity remains the same (e.g., Sensitive to Sensitive), they are\nnot allowed to reassign\nthe tag\nLinking Columns to Tags\nUsers can associate columns with terms that have the same or\nlower\nseverity level.\nExample:\nIf a column is classified as\nSensitive\nor\nPublic\n, and a term is marked as\nSensitive\n, the column can be linked to that term.\nNote:\nIf a user tries to link a column to a term with\nhigher\nseverity, DvSum will display a warning message.\nSeverity-Based Linking Rules\nThe ability to link columns and terms depends on their classification severity:\nFrom a Term\n:\nA user can link a column only if the\ncolumn’s severity is equal to or less than\nthe term’s severity.\nFrom a Column\n:\nA user can link a term only if the\nterm’s severity is equal to or greater than\nthe column’s severity.\nThis keeps the logic aligned with the data model and avoids inappropriate tag associations.\nTag Behavior:\nEach classification tag in DvSum can be configured to trigger specific privacy-related actions. These behaviors are determined by the\nseverity level\nof the tag and are enforced consistently throughout the platform.\nDefault Tag Behaviors:\nInternal / Public\n: Columns are marked as default; no masking is applied.\nSensitive\n: Data is masked as \"XXX\" throughout the application.\nRestricted\n: Columns are both hidden and masked as \"XXX\" throughout the application. This behavior can be modified by a Data Security Admin.\nEach classification tag can be configured to perform specific privacy actions, such as:\nMasking\n: Replacing sensitive data with masked values like \"XXX\".\nHiding\n: Making columns invisible to users without appropriate access.\nDefault Behavior When Tag or Access Is Not Specified\nIn cases where classification or access settings are not explicitly provided:\nIf\nno classification tag is assigned\n, the column or term\ndefaults to Public\n.\nIf\n“Masked”\naccess is set, the behavior will follow that of the\nSensitive\ntag.\nIf\n“No Access”\nis set, the behavior will follow that of the\nRestricted\ntag.\nDefault Configuration Examples:\nRestricted\n: Columns are masked and hidden across the application.\nSensitive\n: Columns are masked, and a sensitivity icon appears next to the column name.\nCustomization:\nData Classification Tagset\nThe “Classification” tagset is a system-defined tagset created by default in DvSum to enforce data privacy and masking policies.\nDefault Configuration:\nExists by default in the system.\nApplies to assets such as columns, tables, and glossary terms.\nSupports one or multiple classifications per asset, depending on the\n“Only Single Value Allowed”\nsetting.\nDefault tags: Public, Internal, Sensitive, Restricted.\nNote:\nThis customization can only be performed by users with Data Security Admin privileges.\nWhat Can Be Modified (by Data Security Admin):\nUsers can tailor the tagset to match their organization’s sensitivity framework. They can:\nRename tags (e.g., change “Sensitive” to “Confidential”)\nChange the associated asset types (e.g., apply to Columns, Tables, Terms)\nAdd new tags (new tags are created with low severity by default)\nAdjust the\n“Only Single Value Allowed”\nsetting:\nCheck\nit if only one classification tag should be assigned per asset.\nUncheck\nit to allow multiple classification tags per asset.\nWhat Cannot Be Modified:\nTagset Type is Fixed:\nThis tagset’s type is always set to \"Classification\" and cannot be changed to another type.\nData Masking in Rule Execution & Export\nWhen a column is marked as\nSensitive\n, it is masked as \"XXX\" throughout the UI.\nThe same masking applies during\nrule execution\n.\nIf the rule runs on a table containing masked columns, the resulting\nexported Excel file\nwill also display masked values for those columns.",

Data Security Admins\nThe Account Admins can add Data Security admins from the User Security tab which is present in the Account Settings page.\nIn the dropdown, all the active users in the application will be shown. The users who have \"Admin\" access to the catalog can only be added as Data Security Admins. The users who do not have \"Admin\" access to the catalog can be added to the list of Data Security Admins but there will be a warning sign shown to update its permissions.\nIn this case, the user \"Hassan Ghafoor\" is in the list of Data Security Admins but actually not a Data Security admin until its permissions are not set to Catalog Admin. On clicking \"Update User Role\", the user settings will open from where permissions can be changed:\nNow when the user is logged in from the Data Security Admin account there will be some extra options that will be available on the Data Dictionary and Field Dictionary:\n2. Hiding Tables and Columns\nData Security Admins see additional options on the Database Tables page that other users cannot see which allow them to hide and show objects. When any tables are selected from the Database Tables, the \"More Actions\" button will be visible. The \"More Actions\" button is a drop-down with the following 3 options:\nHide Table(s)\nUnhide Table(s)\nDelete Table(s)\nWhen any tables are selected and the user selects the option \"Hide Table(s)\" then all the selected tables will be hidden.

Deleting Assets(Tables, Columns and Rules):\nDeleting Table and Columns:\nThe selected tables and columns can be deleted and they will be removed from everywhere on the application:\nNote:\nTo delete tables or columns, users must either be the owners of those assets with Catalog Admin permissions and have the Data Security Admin role.\nDeleting rules:\nThe selected rules can be deleted by clicking the\nMore Actions\ndropdown. Once deleted, they will be removed from everywhere on the application.\nNote:\nTo delete rules, users must either be the rule’s creator with\nCatalog Admin\npermissions or have the\nData Security Admin\nrole.\n4. Adding \"Data Classification\" Tags\nUsers can add the \"Data Classification\" tags which can be added only by Data Catalog Admins:\nThe following 4 tags can be seen on the \"Data Classification\":\nInternal\nPublic\nRestricted\nSensitive\nThe description of every tag can be seen on hover. For more information about the tags separately there is the link of the \"\nData Masking\n\" article.\nOnce any tag is assigned to column(s), they can be seen on the listing view:\nThe selected columns can also be deleted and they will be removed from everywhere on the application:\nNote: For the deletion of columns, users should have Catalog Admin permissions but they don't have to be necessarily Data Security Admin\nOne More thing to note here is that only the tables or columns that will have the status \"Deleted\" can be deleted from the Catalog.\nManaging Data Classification Tags\nAs a\nData Security Admin\n, you are responsible for applying classification tags (such as\nConfidential\n,\nPII\n, etc.) to data assets like columns, tables, and glossary terms.\nTagging behavior depends on how the\nCustom Tagset\nis configured in the system.\nSingle vs Multiple Tags\nEach tagset has a setting:\n“Only Single Value Allowed”\n. This determines whether you can assign\nonly one\ntag or\nmultiple\ntags from that tagset to a single asset.\nIf\nchecked\n, you can apply\nonly one\nclassification tag per asset.\nIf\nunchecked\n, you can apply\nmultiple classification tags\nto the same asset.\nThis allows more flexibility in labeling data that falls under more than one classification (e.g., both\nInternal\nand\nConfidential\n).",

An\nempty\nvalue means an empty string (\n''\n) is stored in a column, especially in string-type fields. Understanding this difference is crucial, as the concept is used in\nBlanks\nand\nValue Range Rule\nchecks. A\nnull\nmeans no value has been stored—you'll see it\nNULL\nexplicitly written in the database.\n1. Understanding the concept of Empty Strings\nBefore jumping into the application, let's try to understand the concept directly from the database. Here, we have a column named\n\"capital\"\n, and we can see that empty strings are stored in it—these are empty values:\nNow, if we check the same column in the application, we can see that the\n\"capital\"\ncolumn has some empty values.\nIf we apply the\nBlanks Rule\nwith the\n\"Empty\"\ncheckbox selected, 4 exceptions are expected. Navigate to the\nBlanks Rule\nand apply this check.\nNote:\nSelecting at least one of the checkboxes is necessary to save the Blanks Rule.\nAfter saving and running the rule, the number of exceptions will be\n4\n, which is the expected result.\nThis same check for\nempty strings\ncan also be used in the\nValue Range Rule\n, and the concept remains the same as explained above.\n2. Understanding the concept of Nulls\nNow, let’s consider the same\n\"capital\"\ncolumn. In the database, we can see entries where it\n[NULL]\nis mentioned—these are the\nnull\nvalues.\nFrom the profiling information in the application, we can see that the\n\"capital\"\ncolumn also has some null values.\nIf we apply the\nBlanks Rule\nwith the\n\"Null\"\ncheckbox selected, the expected number of exceptions will be\n284\n.\nAs shown earlier, the same check is available in the\nValue Range Rule\n, and the concept is identical. In the\nRuleset Rule\n, both\nBlanks\nand\nValue Range\nchecks are available, and the logic remains the same.\nAdditional Resources\nTo better understand the context of this article, it’s essential to be familiar with the following rules, as they are used when applying blank and null checks:\nFoundational DQ - Blanks Rule\nFoundational DQ - Value Range Rule\nFoundational DQ - Ruleset Rule",

High-quality data ensures better decision-making, compliance, and operational efficiency. The Data Quality tab in DvSum contains all the settings related to rules. Users can access the Recommended & Available Rules created for the table opened and create new rules. This article provides an overview of all the major options available in the Data Quality tab.\nEdit Table\nEdit the table details by clicking on the\nGear Icon\nbutton\nThe following fields can be edited:\nLoad Profile\nAll Data\n: Select this load profile if data is fully refreshed regularly.\nIncremental Data\n: Select this if data is normally loaded incrementally (appended).\nMetric Time\n: If the load profile is set to incremental, then select from the Data and Timestamp fields in the table. This field will be used in relevant DQ rules, such as calculating daily load volumes.\nException Record Limit\nUsers can define a threshold for how many exceptions a rule can generate. For example, if the user does not want more than 500 exceptions for any rule created on the table, they can set this limit accordingly.\nFilter Condition\nThe\nRich Filter Condition\nallows users to specify specific conditions to apply to columns before executing rules. Users can add a\nFilter Condition\nor a\nCustom Expression\n.

The integration ensures that Jira tickets can be created and assigned properly.\nPrerequisite:\nConfiguring User Settings in JIRA\nThe Admin of the JIRA account first needs to add users to the account, who will create API tokens and create JIRA integration in DvSum.\nOnce the user is added, the role must be assigned to the user, and the minimal role that must be assigned is \"User.\"\nAfter the user is added to the organization, the user must be added to the project on which the Jira integration will be created. On Jira, select your project and go to its settings, where users can be added:\nWhile adding the user, the user must have a \"Member\" level role at a minimum to be able to create tickets in Jira.\nOnce the user is added to the project, they will receive an invite, and this user can now create an API token from this account, and the user will be able to create Jira integration in DvSum.\nSteps to Configure Jira Integration:\nNavigate to the\nAdministration\ntab >\nAccount\n.\nClick on the\nIntegrations\ntab\n.\nClick\nAdd\nIntegration and choose\nJira\n.\n4. Fill in the required fields:\nName:\nProvide a recognizable name for the integration.\nService URL:\nEnter the URL of your Jira instance.\nProject Key:\nEnter the project key (The key you provided while creating the project in Jira for ticket creation).\nUsername/Email:\nEnter the Jira account username or email.\nAPI Token:\nAdd the Jira API token if you already have one.\nIf you want to generate a new one, you can click on the link button, which will navigate you to the Atlassian/Jira account.\nHow to create a Jira API token:\nLog in to your Atlassian/Jira account in a browser.\nOpen Account Settings → Security → API tokens (or navigate to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens).\nClick Create API token and provide a label (for example: Token Name, like (Jira Integration), and token expiry date).\nGiven the token name\nSet the expiry date and click on create.\nOnce done, copy the generated token.\nPaste this token into the integration’s API Token field within the DvSum app.\nJira Cloud API tokens inherit the permissions of the user who created them. Ensure that the user has appropriate access to the project.\nNote:\nAt present, the Create API token with scopes option is not supported. Only the standard Create API token functionality is available.\nOnce the Jira account details are added and tested successfully, at the end of the connection details, you will see the project details, e.g., Issue Type, Priority, and Assignee.\nNote:\nWhen adding or editing an Integration, if incorrect details or invalid credentials are entered, the system will still allow the test connection and to save it. However, the Integration will not be usable until the credentials are verified.\nConfiguring Jira in DQ Rules\nEnable Integration\nOnce Jira integration is complete, rules can be configured to create tickets when exceptions are detected.\nNavigate to DQ Rules.\nSelect a rule where you want Jira integration to be enabled.\nGo to Edit Settings and navigate to External Ticketing.\nTurn on the option Enable Jira Ticket Creation.\nSelect the integration value from the dropdown.\nDefine how exceptions should trigger ticket creation:\nManual creation.\nAutomatic creation (based on exception detection only)\nClick on save.\nTicket Creation Modes\nManual Ticket Creation\nNavigate to a DQ rule with exceptions.\nClick the Create Ticket button.\nFill in ticket details\nRecords to include\n(You can select any one option based on what exceptions you want to see as an attachment in the ticket).\nSelect Issue Type (the dropdown will show the values defined in your Jira project).\nTitle (By default, it will show the rule description, but you can add your own defined title as well).\nThe\ndescription\nfield has the pre-defined format, but you can also add a description or the details as per what you want to see in the ticket.\nSelect the\nassignee\nof the ticket from the dropdown (these are the users who are added in your Jira project).\nClick on the create button to finish.\nAs soon as you click the Create button, a Jira ticket will be created that is linked to the DQ rule.\nNote:\nClicking on the ticket ID will redirect you to the Jira account for a detailed view of the ticket. You can see the ticket was created.\nRecords To Include Options:\nAll Exception:\nIt will record all the exceptions in the ticket.\nException records since last ticket creation:\nThis includes only the exceptions that have appeared since the last time a ticket was created.\nException records since last ticket creation from latest run only:\nIt captures exceptions from the most recent run of the rule execution that also haven’t been ticketed yet.\nNote: Since both options are related to Exception Tracing, they will only be enabled when Exception Tracing is turned on.\nFor more details on how to configure exception tracing on DQ rules, you can go through this article on\nConfiguring Exception Settings for Rules in DvSum\n.\nNo Exception ticket:\nThese are tickets that are created manually or for reasons other than automatic exceptions.\nIf the ticket is newly created, it will capture only the exceptions that have occurred since the last ticket creation. This ensures that previously logged exceptions are not duplicated, and the ticket reflects only the latest set of issues that need attention.\nAutomatic Ticket Creation\nNavigate to a DQ rule with exceptions.\nGo to Edit Settings and navigate to External Ticketing.\nChange creation mode to Automatic\nChoose the exception option under the Records to Include.\nSelect the Issue type and assignee\nNote:\nFor automatically generated tickets, fields such as the title and description cannot be manually controlled. These are automatically populated and updated based on the rule configuration.\nAfter saving the settings, the Create Ticket button will be disabled, and a ticket will be created automatically during the next execution of the rule.\nTicket Workflow & Status Sync\nTo Do:\nWhen a new ticket is created, the ticket action workflow is enabled, and the initial status is set to To Do.\nIn Progress:\nWhen a ticket’s status is updated from To Do to In Progress in Jira, the change automatically syncs with the DvSum rule detail page. This triggers the workflow, and the rule status is updated to In Progress.\nJira Ticket\nDvSum Rule\nResolved/Done:\nWhen the assignee updates the ticket status to Resolved or Done, the workflow syncs with the rule, and the rule status is updated to Resolved.\nNote:\nIf the DQ workflow is enabled for this rule, its execution will be managed through the associated Jira ticket. The workflow status will mirror the Jira ticket status, meaning the rule is governed via Jira instead of the action workflow.\nTicket ID Column\nA new column called Ticket ID has been added in the DQ Dictionary governance view available column and in the data tab of the rule detail page as well, which displays only the most recently created ticket for the rule.\nNon-Exception Rule Ticket Creation\nFor non-exception rule types such as Unique Values, Count, Metric (Sum), and Freshness, Jira tickets can be created either manually or through automatic ticket creation.\nThe overall process for creating a Jira ticket is a little simpler for these rules, as they don't have any exception dat,a so a simple ticket with title and description is created\nBehavior Based on Rule Status\nIf the rule status is Healthy, then a manual ticket can bee created but an automatic ticket can not be created.\nIf the rule status is Alerting, then both manual and automatic tickets can be created.\nMass Update\nUsers can now update DQ rules to integrate with Jira using the mass update functionality from the DQ Dictionary listing view.\nNavigate to the DQ Dictionary listing view.\nSelect one or more DQ rules, then click Mass Update.\nFrom the drop-down, choose Ticketing Integration.\nSelect the desired action (Update or Make Empty) and then pick the appropriate Jira integration value.\nClick Apply to save the changes.\nSummary\nThe Jira integration with DvSum streamlines exception management for DQ rules by:\nAllowing\ndirect Jira ticket creation\n(manual or automatic) from within the platform.\nEnsuring tickets are linked to specific rules, making it easy to track health and resolution.\nProviding a\nsingle view in DvSum\nto monitor rule exceptions and related tickets.\nLeveraging Jira’s workflows, notifications, and project tracking features for efficient issue resolution.",

Enable Query History in Snowflake\n5. Enable Query History in MySQL\n6. Enable Query History in Netezza\n7. Query History in Oracle\nIntroduction\nQuery history plays a vital role in data lineage formation within applications. By capturing the details of query execution it allows for precise tracking of how data flows and evolves. This article provides a detailed guide to enabling query history across major data platforms such as Databricks, SQL Server, Azure SQL, Azure Synapse, PostgreSQL, and Snowflake. It also touches on additional considerations for databases where query history is enabled by default, such as Oracle and Netezza.\nWhether working with on-premises databases or cloud-based solutions, this guide will help you configure query history to ensure seamless lineage formation and support effective data analysis and governance.\n1. Enable Query History on Databricks\nTo activate\nQuery History\nin Databricks for lineage tracking, follow these essential steps:\nAuthenticate\nusing one of the supported methods:\nPersonal Access Token (PAT)\nOAuth Client Credentials (Client ID & Secret)\nAssign necessary permissions\nat multiple levels:\nCatalog\nCluster\nSQL Warehouse\n(Optional)\nVerify access\nby executing a validation query or making an API call to confirm that historical query data is being captured successfully.\nChoose an Authentication Method\nYou can authenticate using either a\nPersonal Access Token\nor\nClient Secret credentials\nfor the service principal.\nPersonal Access Token\nOpen your workspace’s\nAdmin Settings\n(click your username in the top bar > Admin Settings).\nGo to the\nAdvanced\ntab.\nUnder\nAccess Control\n:\nEnable\nPersonal Access Token\n.\nClick on\nPermission Settings\n.\nSearch for your user.\nAssign the\n\"Can Use\"\npermission.\nClick\nAdd\n.\nOnce enabled, run the Lineage scans on the Databricks source to begin bringing in Lineage data into the application.\nClient Secret Credentials (Alternative to Personal Access Token)\nIf using Client Secret credentials, ensure the following permissions are in place:\nNavigate to\nAdmin Settings > Access Control\n.\nAssign the following minimum required permissions:\nWorkspace permissions\n: Can Use\nCatalog access\n: Required permissions at the catalog level (see next section).\nCompute access\n: Can Attach To for the cluster or SQL Warehouse permissions.\n2. Enable Catalog access for Users\nLog into your Databricks workspace.\nClick on the\nCatalog\ntab in the left menu.\nSelect the\ncatalog\nconfigured for Lineage.\nOpen the\nPermissions\ntab.\nClick\nGrant\n.\nSearch for your\nuser or service principal\n.\nGrant the necessary privileges; at a minimum, SELECT and READ_METADATA are required.\nClick\nGrant\n.\nEnable cluster access for the User\nTo configure the\nCompute\ncluster permissions:\nNavigate to the\nPermissions\nsection.\nSelect the relevant\nuser\nor\nservice principal.\nSet the permission to\nCan Attach To\n.\nTo configure the SQL Warehouse permissions:\nNavigate to the Permissions\nAssign the permission level Can Use\nGrant Access to\nsystem.access\nSchema for Lineage Queries\nDatabricks now provides access to fine-grained query history and user actions via the\nsystem.access\nschema.\nThis schema is required to access detailed historical logs used for lineage tracking.\nSteps:\nNavigate to\nthe Catalog Explorer in your Databricks workspace.\nExpand the\nsystem\ncatalog and select the\naccess\nschema.\nClick the\nPermissions\ntab.\nGrant your user or service principal the following\nminimum permissions\n:\nSELECT\nUse_Schema\nExample SQL (if using Unity Catalog SQL):\nGRANT\nSELECT\n, Use_Schema\nON\nSCHEMA system.access\nTO\n`your\n-\nuser\n-\nor\n-\nservice\n-\nprincipal`;\nThis enables your application or service principal to query audit tables like\nquery_history\n,\nquery_text\n, and\nquery_execution\n.\nDatabricks Validation Check: Did it work?\nYou can test access by calling the query history endpoint using\ncurl\n:\ncurl --location\n'https://<DATABRICKS_HOST>/api/2.0/sql/history/queries'\n\\\n--header\n'Authorization: Bearer <PAT/ OAUTH token>'\nReplace\n<DATABRICKS_HOST>\nwith your workspace URL and\n<PAT/ OAUTH token>\nwith your personal access or OAuth token.\n2. Enable Query History in SQL Server, A\nzure SQL, Azure Synapse\nUse the\nQuery Store\n.\nThe Query Store is enabled by default for new Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance databases.\nQuery Store is not enabled by default for SQL Server 2016 (13.x), SQL Server 2017 (14.x), SQL Server 2019 (15.x). It is enabled by default in the\nREAD_WRITE\nmode for new databases starting with SQL Server 2022 (16.x). To enable features to better track performance history, troubleshoot query plan related issues, and enable new capabilities in SQL Server 2022 (16.x), we recommend enabling Query Store on all databases.\nQuery Store is not enabled by default for new Azure Synapse Analytics databases.\nEnabling the Query Store can be done in multiple ways.\nEnable Query Store using the Query Store page in SQL Server Management Studio\nIn Object Explorer, right-click a database, and then select\nProperties\n.\nNote: Requires version 16 or later of Management Studio\nIn the\nDatabase Properties\ndialog box, select the\nQuery Store\npage.\nIn the\nOperation Mode (Requested)\nbox, select\nRead Write\n.\nEnable Query Store using Transact-SQL statements\nUse the\nALTER DATABASE\nstatement to enable the query store for a given database. For example:\nALTER DATABASE <Your Database name>\nSET QUERY_STORE (QUERY_CAPTURE_MODE = ALL);\nIn Azure Synapse Analytics, enable the Query Store without additional options, for example:\nALTER DATABASE <database_name>\nSET QUERY_STORE = ON;\nSQL Server, Azure SQL, Azure Synapse Validation Check: Did it work?\nAfter completing the above steps, verify that query logging is properly enabled by running the following SQL query:\nSELECT TOP 100 qsr.*\nFROM sys.query_store_query qsr\nLEFT JOIN sys.query_store_query_text qsrt\nON qsr.query_text_id = qsrt.query_text_id\nLEFT JOIN sys.query_context_settings qcs\nON qcs.context_settings_id = qsr.context_settings_id\nLEFT JOIN sys.schemas s\nON s.schema_id = qcs.default_schema_id;\n3. Enable Query History in PostgreSQL\nTo enable query history in PostgreSQL, you can modify the configuration file (postgresql.conf) and use SQL statements for more fine-grained control.\nModify postgresql.conf\nYou need superuser privileges to edit this file.\nYou can locate\npostgresql.conf\nin your PostgreSQL data directory.\nCommon locations include:\n/etc/postgresql/<version>/main\n(Linux)\nC:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\<version>\\data\n(Windows)\nEdit\npostgresql.conf\nSet\nlogging_collector\nto '\non\n'\nSet\nlog_statement\nto 'all' to track SQL queries. For reference, these are the valid values:\nnone\n(default): Log no statements.\nddl\n: Log data definition language (DDL) statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.\nmod\n: Log moderate-level statements, including DDL and most of the data manipulation language (DML) statements.\nall\n: Log all statements, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and more.\nUse SQL Statements for Fine-Grained Control\nIf you want to enable or disable query history for specific databases or sessions, you can use SQL statements. This can be especially useful for debugging or auditing purposes. You can change logging settings on a per-session or per-database basis using the following SQL commands:\nTo enable query history for the current session only:\nSET log_statement = 'all';\nTo enable query logging for a specific database (replace your_database with the actual database name):\nALTER DATABASE your_database SET log_statement = 'all';\nTo disable query logging for a specific database:\nALTER DATABASE your_database SET log_statement = 'none';\nThese SQL statements will take effect immediately for the current session or database.\nRemember to be cautious with query history in production environments, as it can generate large log files and potentially impact performance. Always monitor your log files and adjust the log level as needed to balance the need for more information and the need for better performance.\nPostgreSQL Validation Check: Did it work?\nAfter completing the above steps, verify that query logging is properly enabled by running the following SQL query:\nS\nELECT\npst.\n*\nFROM\npg_stat_statements pst\nLEFT\nJOIN\npg_database pd\nON\npst.dbid\n=\npd.\"oid\"\nLEFT\nJOIN\npg_catalog.pg_user pu\nON\npu.usesysid\n=\npst.userid\nLIMIT\n10\n;\nThis query will return the recent queries logged in PostgreSQL. If it returns results, query logging is successfully enabled.\n4. Enable Query History in Snowflake\nQuery history is always enabled in Snowflake. So the only task required is to make sure that the relevant user has access to the history.\nThe configured user should have access to SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY\nBy default, the SNOWFLAKE database is visible to all users; however, access to schemas in this database can be granted by a user with the ACCOUNTADMIN role using either of the following approaches:\nGrant IMPORTED PRIVILEGES on the SNOWFLAKE database.\nUSE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;\nGRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE SYSADMIN;\nGRANT IMPORTED PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE SNOWFLAKE TO ROLE customrole1;\nFor more information regarding snowflake, this article\nAccount Usage in Snowflake\ncan be referred\nSnowflake Validation Check: Did it work?\nAfter completing the above steps, verify that query logging is properly enabled by running the following SQL query:\nSELECT\nQUERY_ID,\nQUERY_TEXT,\nDATABASE_NAME,\nSCHEMA_NAME,\nQUERY_TYPE,\nUSER_NAME,\nEXECUTION_STATUS,\nSTART_TIME,\nEND_TIME,\nTOTAL_ELAPSED_TIME,\nSESSION_ID\nFROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY\nWHERE START_TIME > (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '30 DAY')\nLIMIT 10;\n5. Enable Query History in MySQL\nMySQL does not provide a built-in query history like some other databases, but query history can be tracked using the following methods:\nUsing the\nMySQL General Query Log\nThe General Query Log records all queries executed on the server.\nSteps to Enable:\nEnable the general log:\nSET\nGLOBAL\ngeneral_log\n=\n'ON'\n;\nSET\nGLOBAL\nlog_output\n=\n'TABLE'\n;\n-- or 'FILE'\nIf using the\nTABLE\noption, view the logs:\nSELECT\n*\nFROM\nmysql.general_log;\nIf using the\nFILE\noption, check the log file location:\nSHOW\nVARIABLES\nLIKE\n'general_log_file'\n;\nConsiderations:\nEnabling the General Query Log may impact performance.\nLogs should be cleared regularly to avoid storage issues.\nUsing the\nMySQL Performance Schema\nThe Performance Schema tracks recent queries with performance-related details.\nSteps:\nEnable the\nperformance_schema\nin the MySQL configuration file (\nmy.cnf\nor\nmy.ini\n):\n[mysqld]\nperformance_schema\n=\nON\nRestart the MySQL server.\nQuery the\nevents_statements_history\ntable for recent queries:\nSELECT\n*\nFROM\nperformance_schema.events_statements_history;\nFor a summary of all queries:\nSELECT\nDIGEST_TEXT, COUNT_STAR\nFROM\nperformance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest\nORDER\nBY\nCOUNT_STAR\nDESC\n;\nAdditional Notes on Performance Schema Query History:\nDefault Behavior:\nThe\nevents_statements_history\ntable stores only a limited number of entries, depending on the\nperformance_schema\nconfiguration.\nCheck the current size limit:\nSHOW\nVARIABLES\nLIKE\n'performance_schema_events_statements_history_size'\n;\nIncreasing History Size:\nTo retain more query history, adjust the\nevents_statements_history_size\nparameter:\nEdit the\nmy.cnf\nor\nmy.ini\nfile:\n[mysqld]\nperformance_schema_events_statements_history_size\n=\n10000\nRestart MySQL to apply changes.\nAlternatively, change the size dynamically for the current session:\nSET\nGLOBAL\nperformance_schema_events_statements_history_size\n=\n10000\n;\nAfter increasing the history size, more queries will be stored in\nevents_statements_history\n.\nMySQL Validation Check: Did it work?\nAfter completing the above steps, verify that query logging is properly enabled by running the following SQL query:\nSELECT ess.*\nFROM performance_schema.events_statements_summary_by_digest ess\nLEFT JOIN performance_schema.events_statements_history esh\nON ess.DIGEST = esh.DIGEST\nLIMIT 10;\n6. Enable Query History in Netezza\nIn Netezza, query history can be accessed using the\nHISTDB.HISTDBOWNER.NZ_QUERY_HISTORY\ntable, which is part of the History Database (HISTDB). This advanced feature provides detailed historical information about queries, sessions, and system activity.\n7. Query History in Oracle\nFor Oracle-specific lineage and query history setup, refer to\nConfigure Oracle as a Source\n.",

These tables are visually indicated by a dotted line around their boundary and placeholder text will be written on the node.\nKey behaviors of placeholder tables:\nThey will\nnot be accessible elsewhere\nin the application except in the lineage view.\nThe\nReference View\nfor placeholder tables\nwill not open\n.\nThe\nReference View for their columns will also not open\n.\nOther than the above two options, the rest of the options on the placeholder node will be the same as that of any other table node.\nThis ensures that users can now identify and track placeholder tables within the lineage flow while maintaining standard lineage functionalities.\nHeader Options\nSearch:\nSearch for specific tables, nodes, or columns within the lineage view. Searches highlight all relevant elements, providing a quick way to locate specific data flows.\nReset View\n: Resets the visualization to the default reference node view.\nShare Lineage:\nShares a link to this lineage view with people or groups\nLayers:\nThis displays two new options when clicked\nData Quality (DQ) Observability and Data Classification\nDQ Observability\n: Highlights upstream nodes in the lineage view with active alerting rules applied.\nData Classification\n: Sensitive data tags and classifications (e.g., PII, PCI) are prominently displayed within the lineage visualization.\nExploring Functional and Technical Lineage\nFunctional Lineage\nFunctional lineage illustrates the data flow at an abstract level, showing tables, columns, and relationships (Everything discussed above was Functional Lineage)\nTechnical Lineage\nTechnical lineage includes:\nSource and target code blocks derived from query history.\nAttribute-level insights are not available for precise analysis.\nIf the angle brackets are clicked the code is displayed:\nETL Nodes in Technical Lineage\nTechnical Lineage also includes\nETL Nodes\n, representing\nStored Procedures (SPs)\nin the database. Stored Procedures are pre-written SQL scripts that execute complex data transformations and manipulations within the database. In our application, we refer to them as\nETL Nodes\n.\nKey Features of ETL Nodes:\nTransformations on Columns\n: ETL Nodes display the transformations applied to tables and columns within the lineage.\nStored Procedure Code Visibility\n: Users can now\nview the full SQL code of the stored procedure\nfrom the ETL node.\nColumn-Level Transformations\n: The lineage details now include transformations applied at the column level, providing deeper insights into data movement.\nJust like any other node, the ETL node can also be set as context for viewing lineage from its perspective. The same thing can be done on transformations on ETL nodes.\nManaging Lineage Permissions in User Roles\nThe\nLineage\nsection in user roles configuration allows managing access to lineage data. Below are the available permissions:\nPermission Levels\nUser access to lineage features depends on assigned roles:\nNo Access\n: Restricts lineage visibility.\nFunctional Lineage\n: Allows entity and attribute-level exploration.\nFunctional and Technical Lineage\n: Grants full access, including technical insights.\nEntity Level\n: Displays relationships between entities like tables or datasets.\nEntity-Attribute Level\n: Shows relationships at both entity and attribute levels.\nCurrent Functionality\nAdmin Role\n: Only admins can upload lineage data through the import process.\nUpstream Nodes\n: Users can add upstream nodes at the\ntable level\nbut not at the\ncolumn level\n.\nDemonstration\nTo add an upstream node:\nGo to the\nTable Detail Page\n.\nClick\nEdit\nto add upstream nodes at the table level.\nSupported Data Sources\nLineage functionality is currently supported for:\nRelational Databases\n: Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, IBM Db2, Azure SQL\nData Lakes and Warehouses\n: Snowflake, Databricks, Azure Synapse, Netezza, Amazon S3\nBI Tools\n: Tableau, Power BI\nNot Supported\n: MongoDB, Salesforce, Azure Data Lake, and file uploads.\nEnabling Lineage in Oracle\nTo enable lineage tracking from Oracle in DvSum, especially when stored procedures or packages are involved, the following setup is required.\nAccessing Stored Procedure/Package Code\nTo extract lineage from stored procedures or packages, DvSum needs access to their source code. This source code is stored in Oracle’s\nALL_SOURCE\nsystem view. The Oracle user should have\nread-only access\nto this view to allow DvSum to parse the code and identify lineage relationships.\nYou can use the following SQL query to retrieve the procedure or package code:\nSELECT\nOWNER,\nNAME,\nTYPE,\nTEXT,\nLINE\nFROM\nALL_SOURCE\nWHERE\nOWNER IN ('{schema_names}')\nNote\n: Replace\n{schema_names}\nwith the actual schema names where the procedures or packages are defined.\nSource Configuration Requirement\nMake sure that all relevant schemas (where the procedure or package code resides) are included in the source configuration in DvSum. If any required schemas are missing, lineage extraction may not work as expected.",

    "content": "In this Article\nIntroduction\nData Model Tab\nAdd/Edit Relationships\nSetting Tables as Context\nGrid View\nLevels in ERD\nIntroduction\nAn Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a visual map that acts like a flowchart, revealing the connections between various elements, such as people, objects, or ideas, within a system. In our application, the ER Diagram serves as a helpful tool to show how different datasets and their respective columns are related. It provides a clear, organized view, allowing users to grasp the connections between datasets and gain a deeper understanding of the overall data structure. This article explores the role of an ER diagram in improving data comprehension.\nData Model Tab\nNavigate to Dictionaries >Database Tables from the side bar\nClick on a table name\nThe ER diagram can be found on the detail page of any table within the \"Data Model\" tab.\nIn the ER diagram, you'll notice a main table that stands out, and the other tables connected to it are linked with arrows to show their relationships.\nBy default, you can see the name of each table.\nFor more detailed information, you have the option to expand each table to see the specific columns it contains.\nTo the left of the ER diagram there are some interactions such as:\nZoom In\nZoom Out\nFit View\nToggle Interactivity\nUsers can change the zoom level of the diagram based on their preferences. This can be done by either using the mouse scroll along with the CTRL button or through zoom controls. To move around the diagram, users can right-click and drag their mouse to pan the view in different directions.\nThe \"Fit View\" option instantly resets the ER diagram to its default view on the screen.\nThis \"Toggle Interactivity\" function serves to enable or disable various interactions within the ER diagram. For instance, when the toggle interactivity is in the locked state, users cannot add relations or access reference views of columns in the ER diagram.\nAdd/Edit Relationships\nBefore we proceed to add or edit relationships, let's first define the three fundamental relations within the application:\nRelationship added from Database\nRelationship recommended by DvSum\nRelationship added by User\nEvery relationship has a reference view and it can be opened by simply clicking on the line that connects the two tables\nThe Relationship that is added to the database can neither be edited nor deleted.\nThe second type of relationship is the one that is recommended by DvSum. These relationships can be edited or deleted. There is another option of \"Confirm\" along with the \"Edit\". Once the user confirms the relationship this relationship is changed to the \"User added\" relationship type.\nThe \"User added\" relationship is the third type of relationship. One way of making the relationship \"User added\" is just confirming the relationship which is recommended by DvSum:\nAnother method to create a \"User-added\" relationship is by manually adding and defining the relationship.\nTo add a relationship, click on the \"+\" icon located in the top-right corner of the source table. This icon allows users to initiate the process of adding a new relationship.\nOnce the \"+\" icon is clicked the \"Add Relationship\" reference view is opened. Here the Source table is mentioned, Users can add the Reference table from the drop-down menu and define any type of relationship\nAfter adding the Reference table and selecting the Relationship type the user will be required to add source fields and reference fields for which the relationship is being added. Users can add single or multiple columns for the relationship.\nNote\n: It is to be noted that once any column is added to a relationship then that column can not be added again, the column will be greyed out when a user tries to add it to the relationship:\nOnce the relevant fields are added user can click on \"Save Changes\" and the relationship will be created. In this way, the user can add multiple relationships to the source table. The relationship that is added by the user can be edited again by clicking on the line connecting the tables. If the relationship is not required then it can be removed also:\nSetting Tables as Context\nOn the ER diagram other than the source table there is an arrow icon on the other tables on the top right.\nWhen this button is clicked the detail page of the respective table is opened and the Data Model Tab is displayed:\nGrid View\nBy default, the view which is opened is the Model view of the \"Data Model\" tab. Along with the model view, there is another view \"Grid View\" which basically shows all the relationships defined in the ER diagram and some other information. The relationships that are recommended by DvSum or user-added can also be edited/deleted from here.\nLevels in ERD\nThere are levels defined in the ER diagram.\nOn\nLevel 1\nthe tables that are directly related to the source table are shown:\nMoving to\nLevel 2\n, you'll discover the tables associated with tables on Level 1.\nIn the same way, the tables that are further related to the highlighted tables will be shown in the 3rd+ level thus showing the ER diagram in detail.",

It is assigned automatically during the initial scan when the asset enters the system. No review or action is required from data stewards or owners at this stage, and the asset is visible to all users.\nPurpose:\nTo clearly identify assets that are newly introduced into the system and have not yet been compared against any previous scan.\nDefault\nThe\nDefault\nstatus indicates that an asset has remained unchanged since the previous scan.\nFrom the second scan onward, if the scanner finds the same asset with no metadata differences, the status automatically becomes\nDefault\nwithout steward or owner intervention, and visibility remains open to all users.\nPurpose:\nTo show that the asset has been validated by at least one re-scan and is in a consistent, unchanged state compared to its previously scanned version.\nNote:\nIf an asset disappears or its schema changes during the second scan, it moves directly from\nNew → Deleted\n, not Default.\nModified\nThe\nModified\nstatus indicates that the asset’s metadata has been updated by the user compared to the previous version, such as when descriptions, domains, or business metadata are updated. The status will change from\nNew/Default\nto\nModified\nwhen the user manually updates any metadata and saves the asset without publishing it.\nThese assets remain visible to all users but indicate that internal updates have been made and are pending review or publication.\nPublished\nThe\nPublished\nstatus means that the asset has been fully reviewed, validated, and approved. This status is set manually by a user after completing validation.\nWorkflow behavior:\nIf the asset belongs to a\nworkflow-enabled domain\n, the transition from\nModified → Published\nrequires approval from the assigned data steward or data owner.\nIf the asset does\nnot\nbelong to a workflow-enabled domain, it can be published directly without approval.\nDeleted\nThe\nDeleted\nstatus  is assigned automatically when the asset is no longer detected in the source system, such as when a table is dropped or a column is removed or when schema is changed in the source.\nNo steward or owner involvement is needed as this status will be automatically updated after the scan, and deleted items remain visible to all users.\nNote:\nUsers cannot manually change an active asset’s status to Deleted. Deleted assets remain in the system for audit and historical reference.\nPlease refer to this article for more details on how to mark an asset as deleted:\nHow to delete asse\nts\nGlossary Statuses\nThese are the other statuses applicable specifically to Glossary Terms.\nNote:\nWhen creating Views for Glossary Terms, the\nDefault\noption in filters refers to the\nDraft\nstatus.\nDraft\nThe term is created but not yet reviewed or approved; it may still be undergoing edits.\nModified\nIndicates that the term’s metadata has been updated from its previously published state and requires review before re-publishing.\nPublished\nThe term has been reviewed, approved, and validated.\nFor more details on approving and publishing the Glossary Trems, refer to the article:\nApproving Glossary Terms\n.\nNote:\nA status will appear in the filter only if it has been applied to at least one asset. For example, if the\nDraft\nstatus is not applied to any asset, it will not be shown in the filter when the user clicks on the funnel.",

When a user interacts with an AI agent through an API and provides\ncustom properties and parameters\n, those parameters are automatically exposed on the dashboard for further analysis. This enables users to visualize and monitor agent interactions using customizable widgets, filters, and charts all based on the dynamically generated fields.\nCapturing API-based Properties & Parameters\nWhen a user asks a question through the API (for example):\n“Analyze customer IDs 12345658 for FTTH”\nThe request may include additional\nproperties\nand\nparameters\nsuch as location, market code etc.\nAutomatic Reflection on the Dashboard\nAutomatic Reflection on the Dashboard\nThe captured parameters are dynamically displayed in the\nAgent Question Analytics\nof the dashboard.\nWhenever a user adds new properties or parameters through an API query, these are instantly reflected as additional columns in the dashboard dataset.\nFor example, after the query above, the following columns might appear automatically:\nCustomer ID, Location, Market Code, etc.\nNote:\nAnything that is sent as a\nkey–value pair under the “properties” attribute\nin the API request will automatically be captured and shown on the dashboard as a separate field.\nThis means every new key introduced in the API payload appears as its own column in the dataset — no manual configuration or schema update is needed.\nAll parameters or properties captured from the API automatically appear under the\nAdditional Attributes\nsection when creating or editing a widget.\nThis ensures that all newly introduced fields are readily available for selection and analysis.\nExample view:\nThe below image shows how these dynamically generated fields appear within the\nAgent Question Analytics\nwidget.\nExample 2:\nThis chart shows how many records exist for each market code.\nWidget Creation & Customization\nUsers can then navigate to the Dashboard and create a Widget of type\n“Agent Question Analytics.”\nIf you’re not familiar with creating a widget, see the detailed guide here:\nDashboard and Widgets\nWithin this widget:\nUsers can apply slicers (filters) on any of the dynamic parameters such as location, market code, or service type.\nUsers can select chart types (e.g., bar, pie, line, table) to visualize data according to their needs.\nAll the dynamically created columns from the API (e.g., location, market code, tool ID) will be available for data slicing and analysis.\nThis allows flexible visualization of agent query data with no need for predefined schema updates.",

It enables users to locate information quickly without needing to navigate through multiple modules.\nSearching for Assets\nEnterprise Search supports flexible search capabilities to help you find exactly what you are looking for.\nSearch Suggestions\nAs you type a query, Enterprise Search provides real-time suggestions to help refine your search.\nIf the system detects alternate or closely related terms, it displays a\n“Did you mean…”\nline above the suggestion list.\nUsers can click one of the suggested phrases to update the search term or press\nGo\nto execute the current query.\nFuzzy Search\nTypos trigger “Did you mean…?” suggestions, while results are based on exact or prefix matches.\nExpanded Search\nEnable\nExpanded Search\nto include similar and partial matches for broader, more relevant results.\nFor example, if you search for\n“Claim B”\nwith this option checked, results will also include assets containing the word\n“Claim”\n—not just exact matches.\nThis helps surface related or similar assets that might otherwise be missed.\nExample Behavior\nThe “Did you mean…” line shows suggested alternative keywords.\nThe suggestions list shows recent or recommended searches and matching assets with basic metadata.\nClicking a suggestion or the “Did you mean…” phrase runs a new search with that term.\nSearch by Asset Name\nEnter the full or partial name of any dataset, table, report, or rule to view all related results.\nFor example, typing\nSales\nwill bring up all assets whose names contain that keyword.\nNote:\nExact matches to your entered keyword appear at the\ntop of the results\n, allowing quick access to the most relevant tables, columns, or reports.\nSearch by Table and Column Name\nYou can search directly using a table name or column name.\nIf you add a period (\n.\n) and the column name after the table name (for example,\nOrders.OrderDate\n), the search will return all matching assets containing that column.\nThis also supports\nfull-path search\nsuch as\nDB.Schema.Table.Column\n, allowing more precise targeting across complex data models.\nSearch by Unique Asset ID\nEnterprise Search also allows searching through a specific\nunique ID\nof an asset.\nThis ID can be found in the URL of the asset (for example, a Power BI report or dataset).\nEntering this ID in the search bar will return that particular asset directly.\nYou can also paste a\nPower BI report URL\nto locate that exact report in Enterprise Search.\nSearch by Custom Attribute Values\nAssets with custom attributes such as picklist values can be located by searching those values.\nFor example, if a picklist attribute contains values like\nSingle\nor\nDouble\n, typing those terms in the search bar will display all assets assigned with that particular value.\nIn addition to standard assets, Enterprise Search supports a wider range of technical and custom objects including\ndatabases, schemas, stored procedures, and custom assets\n, ensuring broader visibility across your organization’s data catalog.\nUsing Filters\nIn addition to free-text search, users can apply filters to refine search results based on different asset characteristics.\nFiltering Options\nFilters in the left panel enable refinement of search results across asset types such as tables, columns, rules, terms, and agents. Each asset type provides its own set of filter categories, allowing more targeted exploration of data assets.\nFilters available for All Assets\nData Owners -\nFilter by the assigned data owner responsible for the Table.\nData Steward\n- Filter by the assigned data steward responsible for the Table.\nData Domain\n– Filter by assigned domain.\nLast Updated On\n- Filter based on the last updated date.\nStatus\n– Filter based on Deleted, Default, New, Modified, and  Published.\nTags\n– Filter by applied metadata tags.\nAvailable Filters for Tables\nYou can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:\nFormat\n– Filter by format of the data i.e. Files or Tables.\nLast Refreshed On\n– Filter based on the last scan or refresh date.\nRecord Count\n– Filter by data size or volume.\nSource\n– Filter by data source name.\nThe available filter list changes dynamically based on the selected asset type.\nNote:\nSelecting the Plus (+) icon beside a filter reveals available options for more precise asset selection, such as tables, columns, rules, or agents.\nSelecting Clear at the top of the filter section resets all applied filters.\nAvailable Filters (for Columns)\nYou can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:\nData Type\n– Filters by the column’s data type (e.g., String, Integer, Date).\nEmpty or Null\n- Filters based on the number of empty or null values. Users can set the minimum and maximum limits for empty or null values to retrieve the desired columns.\nEntity\n– Filters by the related entity or object.\nTable -\nFilters based on the table names to which the columns belong.\nUnique Count\n– Filters by the distinct value count of a column.\nAvailable Filters for Terms\nYou can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:\nSub-domain\n– Filters by the sub-domain under which the term is classified.\nType\n– Filters by term type (e.g., Business Term, Technical Term).\nFilters for Rules\nYou can refine your search using the filters on the left panel:\nAlert Status\n– Filter by the alert level or current notification state.\nLast Executed On\n- Filters by the latest execution date.\nRule Type\n– Filter by rule type such as Orphan Records, Missing Values, or Data Consistency.\nRun Status\n– Filter by the latest execution status (e.g., Valid, Invalid, Failed).\nSearch Results\nSelecting a column from the search results opens a detailed panel on the right side, displaying key metadata and attributes\nSelecting the arrow icon in the detail panel redirects to the Dictionary tab—specifically to the Database Column page—where the column can be viewed in full context along with related governance information.\nConsistent Result Display\nThe presentation of search results has been standardized to ensure consistent metadata visibility and layout across all asset types.\nThis makes it easier to interpret and compare results within the Enterprise Search interface.\nExample Search Scenarios\nSearching\nOrders\nreturns all tables and reports containing that table name.\nSearching\nOrders.OrderDate\nlists all assets containing that column.\nEntering a unique\nPower BI asset ID\n(from its URL) displays that specific report.\nSearching\nLahore\nreturns all assets with that picklist value assigned in their custom attributes.\nPasting a\nPower BI report URL\nshows the matching report directly.\nApplying filters for\nAsset Type = “Data Quality Rule”\nand\nStatus = “Published”\ndisplays only published data quality rules.\nSummary\nEnterprise Search centralizes discovery across all connected data assets.\nIt helps you find, filter, and access the information you need faster and more efficiently.\nWhether you are searching by name, column, ID, or URL, or refining results through filters and tags, Enterprise Search ensures that all relevant assets are easily within reach.\nNote:\nAI Agents are not included as part of Enterprise Search.",

Unsupported Integration Types\n7.1 Unsupported Databases\n7.2 Unsupported Rule Types\nOverview\nAfter a DQ rule is run, the exception records are stored in encrypted files local to the DvSum gateway when an on-premises gateway is used. The records are stored in an encrypted S3 bucket by default when the cloud gateway is used. In both cases the records are visible to users within the DvSum GUI and via API.\nException Storage Integration allows exception records to be stored in external database tables. This enables easier traceability, auditability, and integration with reporting systems or downstream analytics.\n1. Creating an Integration\n1.1 Access Integration Settings\nNavigate to:\nAdministration → Account → Integrations (Tab)\n1.2 Configure the Integration\nSelect the Data Source Type\nChoose a supported connection (currently limited to databases).\nNote:\nThe Integrations tab is designed to support various types of external connections. As of now, it only supports\nDatabases\n.\nSpecify the Target Table Name\nThis is where rule execution results will be stored.\n2. DDL Script Generation & Execution\nOnce the source is configured, the system auto-generates a\nDDL script\ncontaining predefined columns (e.g., execution ID, rule ID, rule name, rule type, rule description, etc.). These fields are required for writing execution results to the target table.\nDynamic Table Name:\nIf you change the target table name, the table name in the DDL script will auto-update.\nTest Connection:\nIf the user clicks on\nTest Connection\nbefore executing the script in the database, the table will not exist or may not be accessible. As a result, schema validation will be skipped, and the write-back operation will not be performed.\nCopy and Execute the DDL Script\nAfter the DDL is generated,\ncopy it\nusing the\n“Copy Code”\nbutton or from the dialog window.\nExecute the script in the\nsame target database\nselected during integration setup. This creates the required table structure with predefined columns (e.g., execution ID, rule ID, rule name, rule type, etc.)\n3. Test Connection and Validation Steps\nAfter executing the DDL script in the selected database, return to the Integration setup and click\nTest Connection\n. The system performs the following three validation checks:\nTable Existence:\nThe table must exist in the selected database.\nSchema Match:\nThe table structure must match the expected schema (all required columns must be present).\nWrite-Back Access:\nThe system must be able to insert and delete a test record to verify permissions.\n3.1 Schema Match Failures\nIf the table already exists but wasn’t created using the system-generated DDL script, it may lack one or more required columns.\nThe\nTest Connection\nmay fail during the schema validation step.\nClick\n“Show Error Details”\nto view the list of missing or mismatched columns.\n3.2 Write-Back Access Errors\nScenario 1: Missing Insert Permission\nEven if the table structure is correct, the system will show:\n“Write-back access is not allowed – insert permission test failed”\nif the database user does not have insert rights.\nDuring validation, the platform attempts to insert dummy JSON data into the external table and immediately deletes it to confirm access.\nNote:\nThis happens because, during Test Connection, the system tries to insert dummy JSON data into the external table.\nAfter the insertion, it deletes the dummy data. This helps validate whether write-back access is allowed.\nIn this case, the insert test fails due to missing permissions.\nScenario 2: Missing Delete Permission\nIf insert permissions are present but delete permissions are missing, you can see:\n“Write-back access is not allowed – delete permission test failed”\n4. Log All Rule Executions (Optional)\nThis option determines whether you want to store execution results\nonly when exceptions are found\n, or\nfor every run,\neven when no exceptions are triggered.\n4.1 Configuration Option: \"Log All Rule Executions\"\nDuring integration setup, you can see a checkbox labelled\n“Log all rule executions”\n.\nEnabled:\nEvery rule execution is logged in the storage table, regardless of whether exceptions were found.\nDisabled (default):\nOnly executions that generate exceptions are logged.\n4.2 What Happens When Enabled?\nOn enabling this setting and clicking\nSave\n, all future executions of rules linked to this integration will be logged.\nEach run will insert a record in the target table, even when the result is\nhealthy\n(i.e., no exceptions).\nNow store exceptions externally in the specified table.\nBest practice: Enable this option if organization requires\nfull execution history\nfor reporting or compliance purposes.\n5. Enabling Exception Storage on Rules\nTo store exception data from rule executions into the configured external storage, Exception Storage must be explicitly enabled at the\nrule level\n.\n5.1 Navigate to Rule Configuration\nGo to the\nDictionaries\ndropdown\n,\nClick on\nDatabase Tables\n.\nSelect the desired table.\nOpen the\nData Quality\ntab and choose the rule you want to configure.\nClick\nEdit\non the rule.\n5.2 Enable Exception Storage in the Workflow Section\nIn the rule edit screen, scroll to the\nWorkflow\nsection.\nLocate the\nException Configuration\ntab.\nEnable the\nException Storage\ntoggle.\nFrom the dropdown, select one or more configured integrations where exceptions should be stored.\nClick\nSave\n.\nNote:\nUser can configure\nmultiple integrations\nfor a single rule if needed.\nClicking on an\nintegration\nname will redirect to the full\nIntegration configuration page\n, allowing to review or modify its setup.\n6. Running Rules with Exception Storage\nOnce Exception Storage is configured and enabled on a rule, exceptions can be logged to the external table during both\nRun Online\nand\nRun Offline\nexecutions. The mechanism of storing differs slightly based on how the rule is run.\n6.1 Run Rule → Online Execution\nWhen a rule is run manually via\nRun Online\n, a\nConfiguration Preferences\ndialog appears with the following options:\nInclude All Exceptions\n– Check this option to include all exceptions during the rule execution.\nAdd Exceptions to Storage\n– Check this box if you want the exceptions to be stored in the external tables when the rule is run.\nAfter execution:\nA\nsuccess message\nappears confirming that exceptions were loaded into the configured table.\nThe same message also appears in the rule’s\nActivity section\nas a system comment.\nThe user can confirm this by reviewing the corresponding table in their external database.\nNote:\nTo convert the raw exception data into a valid JSON format, users can run the following SQL query on Microsoft SQL server.\nUSE [your_database_name];\n\nSELECT\n execution_id,\n exception_data AS RawExceptionData,\n TRY_CAST(exception_data AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) AS ExceptionData_Text,\n JSON_QUERY(TRY_CAST(exception_data AS NVARCHAR(MAX))) AS FormattedJson\nFROM\n [your_schema_name].[your_table_name]\nWHERE\n execution_id = [your_execution_id];\n6.2 Run Rule → Offline Execution\nWhen a rule runs via\nRun Offline\n(through workflows or schedules), exception storage happens automatically based on the rule's configuration; no manual input is required.\nNotification Email Outcome:\nAfter execution, a notification email is sent to the rule owner and relevant users. The\nWorkflow Action\nsection shows one of the following:\nIf exceptions were stored successfully:\n“Exceptions have been loaded to storage location.”\nIf no integration is configured on the rule:\n“Not Configured.”\n6.3 Gateway Compatibility Scenarios\nWhen the rule and the integration are hosted on different gateway types (On-Prem vs. Cloud), the system behavior varies:\nRule Location\nIntegration Location\nSystem Behavior\nOn-Prem\nCloud\nWarning:\n\"Selected integration uses a different gateway. This integration requires exception data to exit your network temporarily before being stored.\"\nCloud\nOn-Prem\nInfo:\n\"Selected integration uses a different gateway type.\" (Not blocking)\nNote: These messages help clarify when exception data might leave your internal network, allowing teams to address any compliance or security implication\n7. Unsupported Integration Types\n7.1 Unsupported Databases\nThe following integration targets are\nnot supported\n:\nAzure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)\nPower BI\nMongoDB\nAmazon S3\n(Rules can read from S3, but cannot write exceptions to S3 as external storage)\n7.2 Unsupported Rule Types\nAs of now, the following rule types are\nnot supported\nfor Exception Storage:\nFreshness Rules\nMetric Rules\nCount Rules\nUnique Value Rules\nThese rules are not yet compatible with Exception Storage because they do not produce row-level exceptions that can be stored in external systems.\nAll other rule types that generate exception samples are supported.",

    "url": "https://dvsum.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/18139200580116-Adaptive-Thresholds",
    "content": "In this Article:\nWhen to use Adaptive Thresholds\nHow Adaptive Thresholds are Calculated\nExample\nWhy IQR * 1.5?\nHow to set Adaptive Thresholds\nWhen to use Adaptive Thresholds\nClassic data quality (DQ) rules define a test that must be met for data to be considered valid. This could be a simple not-null test or a cross-reference integrity check or a more complex calculation. Typically the acceptable maximum threshold for this test would be zero. Invalid values are not acceptable.\nBut it turns out there are many real-world reasons to allow more flexible thresholds. One reason is that data is known to have a baseline number of invalid records. This is not\ndesired\n, but it's expected. And in practice the team monitoring data quality doesn't want to receive a notification every day that there are invalid records--since that might well be every single day. But they would certainly be interested to get a notification if the number of invalid records spikes one day.\nAn even more common use case for wanting adaptive thresholds is for\ndata observability\ntests. In many situations the number of records arriving each day should be roughly the same. A small variation is expected, but a large variation could indicate a problem. But how can we quantify \"small variation\" and \"large variation\"? This is where adaptive thresholds can help.\nHow Adaptive Thresholds are Calculated\nAdaptive thresholds in DvSum DQ are set using the common statistical technique called Interquartile Range (IQR). In this method, we first calculate the 25th percentile and 75th percentile for past values. These values are referred to as the 1st quartile (Q1) and 3rd quartile (Q3). The IQR is simply the difference between Q3 and Q1. We define outliers as values which are more than 1.5 IQRs below Q1 or more than 1.5 IQRs above Q3.\nExample\nAn example of the adaptive thresholds in action makes them clear. Consider the following values for the number of records loaded daily by a data pipeline.\nYou can also toggle to display the values in a grid. Here are those values:\n1009, 990, 840, 825, 1115, 586, 899, 1029, 773, 1151, 1394, 1327, 870, 1128, 1089, 1097, 982, 741, 1105, 992, 737, 1240, 1014.\nThe first 4 data points have no thresholds displayed. This is because the IQR threshold calculation requires a minimum of 4 previous data points to be meaningful. The thresholds for the 5th data point are calculated as follows.\nThe 4 previous data points: 1009, 990, 840, 825\nQ1: the median of 825 and 840 = 832.5\nQ3: the median of 990 and 1009 = 999.5\nIQR: Q3 - Q1 = 167\nIQR * 1.5 = 250.5\nUpper Threshold: 999.5 + 250.5 = 1250\nLower Threshold: 832.5 - 250.5 = 582\nThe same logic applies in identifying the data on Aug 17 as an outlier. The previous data points (1009, 990, 840, 825, 1115, 586, 899, 1029, 773, 1151) yield a Q1 value of 825 and a Q3 value of 1029. Those correspond to threshold values of 519 and 1,335.\nWhy IQR * 1.5?\nThe intuitive answer is that if the data is truly following a normal distribution and we're only seeing random noise in the results, then setting thresholds like this are expected to generate alerts only very rarely. The data quality team won't get too many notifications. But how many?\nThe complete details of the mathematical calculation are beyond the scope of this article. But setting the bounds at Q1 - 1.5*IQR and Q3 + 1.5*IQR will correspond to setting the bounds at\nμ ± 2.7σ. With these bounds slightly fewer than 1% of measurements from a normal distribution will generate alerts.\nStated in a less-precise but more business-oriented manner, if you get an alert then it's\nquite likely\nthat something went wrong. Maybe a file got loaded twice, or the underlying data has truly changed. You should investigate. But of course it's\npossible\n(about a 0.7% chance) that this is just a random fluctuation in the data.\nHow to set Adaptive Thresholds\nPrerequisite: you have already created a DQ rule. Pipeline checks like COUNT and METRIC are the most common types to use adaptive thresholds. For more details about how to define DQ rules, refer to the\nDQ Rule Details\npage.\nEdit the rule, then navigate to the tab \"Thresholds\".\nThresholds for DQ rules are set in this dialog in DvSum Data Quality:",

By enforcing this rule, one can ensure that all necessary data fields are populated, thus maintaining the quality and reliability of the dataset.\nFor further information about the rule detail page including scope, threshold, notifications, etc., please see the detailed article\nRule Detail page.\nHow to Configure the Rule\nStep 1: Access Data Quality Ruless\nLog in to DvSum and\nNavigate to\nDictionaries\n→\nDatabase Tables.\nSelect the relevant\nData Source\nand\nTable Name\n.\nData Quality\n→ Choose\nAvailable Rules\n.\nStep 2: Create a New Rule\nClick\n\"\n⊕\nAdd Rule\"\n.\nSelect the\n\"Foundational DQ\"\ncategory.\nChoose\n\"BLANKS\"\n.\nStep 3: Define the Rule Parameters\nSelect the\nTable and Column\nwhere blank values should be restricted.\nFill in the Rule Description, and Column name.\nIf user selects:\nTreat Empty Strings as Blanks:\nAny field that contains an empty string (\"\") will be considered as a blank value.\nTreat Null Values as Blanks\n: Database-level NULL values will be treated the same as blank/missing values.\nNote:\nTo know more about the Null and Empty values for Blank Rule, refer the article\nNull and Empty Values.\nStep 4: Save & Run the Rule\nClick\n\"Save Rule\"\n.\nClick \"Run\" to execute and test the rule.",

A higher score indicates that the rule is properly set up, while a lower score suggests areas that may need improvement.

Initiate Password Reset\nNavigate to the DvSum login page:\nhttps://app.dvsum.ai\nClick on the\n\"Forgot Password?\"\nlink located below the password input field.\n2. Verify Your Identity\nEnter the\nemail address\nassociated with your DvSum account.\nClick\n\"Reset my password\"\n.\nTip:\nEnsure the email address is an exact match with what's registered in DvSum.\n3. Retrieve Reset Code\nOpen your inbox and find the email from\nDI Support\n.\nLocate the\n6-digit verification code\nin the email body.\nIf you don’t see the email:\nCheck your spam or junk folder.\nIf still not found, click on the “Resend Verification Email” button to receive a new code.\n4.

Complete the Process\nClick\n\"Change Password\"\nto save changes.\nYou’ll be\nautomatically redirected\nto the login page.\nSign in using your\nemail address and new password\n.\nSSO Flow: Resetting Password After Disabling SSO\nIf your organization has disabled Single Sign-On (SSO), users must log in using standard password authentication. The steps below outline how to reset your password after this transition.\n1. Overview\nSSO allows users to log in via their organization’s authentication provider. However, if SSO is disabled, users need to reset their password manually to regain access.\n2. Disabling SSO (Admin Action)\nNote:\nThis step is typically performed by an administrator.\nStep 1: Navigate to SSO Settings\nLog in to the\nDvSum Application\n.\nGo to\nAdministration → Account Settings → SSO.\nStep 2: Disable SSO Live Mode\nLocate the\nSSO Live Mode\ntoggle switch.\nClick the toggle to\ndisable\nSSO.\nStep 3: Confirm the Action\nA confirmation pop-up will appear.\nClick\nOK\nto proceed.\nOnce disabled, all users will be required to log in using passwords instead of SSO.\n3. Temporary Password Delivery\nAfter SSO is disabled, a system-generated email with a\ntemporary password\nis sent to each registered user's email address.\nDidn’t receive the email?\nCheck your\nspam/junk\nfolder.\nVerify that the correct email address is used.\n4. Log In & Reset Password\nUse the\ntemporary password\nfrom the email to log in at\nhttps://app.dvsum.ai\n.\nUpon login, you’ll be prompted to set a\nnew password\n.\nFollow the same password rules mentioned earlier.\nClick\n\"Save\"\nto update your credentials and complete the login process.\nSSO Flow: Resetting Password when SSO is Live\nOnce SSO is enabled in\nLive Mode\n, DvSum no longer stores user passwords. All authentication is handled by your organization’s Identity Provider (IdP), such as Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), Okta, or Ping.\nPassword reset flow:\nThe\n“Forgot Password”\nlink on the DvSum login page will no longer work.\nUsers must reset their password\ndirectly in the Identity Provider (IdP) system\n.\nAfter resetting the password at the IdP, users can log in to DvSum using their updated SSO credentials.\nDvSum support cannot reset passwords while SSO is Live.\nIf SSO is later disabled:\nDvSum reverts to the standard login mechanism.\nUsers will need to set up new DvSum passwords using the regular password reset process described\nHow to Reset Password on the DI Platform\n.\nReferences:\nOkta Support:\nPassword reset for users created via external IdP must be performed on the IdP.\nOkta Support Article\nMicrosoft Entra (Azure AD) Support:\nUsers must reset their work or school passwords through Azure AD security info or mobile device if locked out.\nMicrosoft Support\nAWS SSO with External Identity Provider:\nPassword reset is not allowed via AWS SSO when using an external identity source.\nAWS Support\nThese references confirm that when SSO is active, password management is handled at the Identity Provider, not within the DvSum application itself.

DvSum uses Amazon Athena to provide access to the files, and it uses AWS Glue Data Catalog to crawl the files and to gather metadata.\nIn order to define a data source in DvSum you must first configure an AWS user with appropriate permissions for\nS3\n,\nAthena\n, and\nGlue\n. Follow the steps below to create a new user with the required permissions or to verify that an existing user has the permissions needed.\nThe detailed steps below explain the process to create a new user in the AWS Console. A command-line version of the same steps is provided as well. Users should follow either the Detailed Steps or the the Command-Line Instructions.\nDetailed Steps\nStep 1: Add a New User\nTypically a new user is created to be used with DvSum. Using an existing user is of course valid as well, but it's important to validate that the user has all permissions documented below.\nTo add a new user, open the AWS Console, navigate to\nIAM → Access Management → User\n, and click on the 'Create user' button.\n1.1 Set User Details\nSet the user name to any valid name, and click on the Next Button.\n1.2 Set Permissions\nSelect \"Attach policies directly\"\n1.3 Create a Policy named \"dvsum-s3-source-policy\"\nClick on the \"Create policy\" button and you will be redirected to the Create Policy page.\nThen click on the JSON button, and paste the JSON provided below. Click the \"Next\" button.\n{\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\": [\n{\n\"Sid\": \"ConfirmPoliciesAndPassRole\",\n\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\"Action\": [\n\"iam:PassRole\",\n\"iam:GetUser\",\n\"iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies\"\n],\n\"Resource\": \"*\"\n}\n]\n}\n1.4 Review and create the Policy\nImportant: the policy name must be exactly the name provide here. The description is optional.\nPolicy name:\ndvsum-s3-source-policy\nPolicy Description: Policy used by DvSum to confirm permissions\nClick the \"Create policy\" button.\n1.5 Add Permissions Policies\n1.5 Add Permissions policies\nReturn to the Create user wizard already in progress from earlier. Select the following permission policies:\nAmazonS3FullAccess\n(AWS managed)\nAmazonAthenaFullAccess\n(AWS managed)\nAWSGlueServiceRole\n(AWS managed)\ndvsum-s3-source-policy\n(customer managed)\nClick the \"\nNext\n\" button.\n1.6 Review and Create User\nReview User details and Permissions Summary. Then click the \"Create user\" button.\nStep 2: Add Role\nAWS Glue requires a role with appropriate permissions which will be passed to the crawler when it runs.\n2.1 Create role\nNavigate to\nIAM → Access management → Roles\nand click the \"Create role\" button.\n2.2 Define trust policy\nIn the first step of the create role wizard, select \"\nCustom trust policy\".\nPaste the code provided below. Click the \"Next\" button.\nCopy from here and paste in the Custom trust policy:\n{\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\": [\n{\n\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\"Principal\": {\n\"Service\": \"glue.amazonaws.com\"\n},\n\"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n}\n]\n}\n2.3 Add permissions\nAdd the following permission policies to the role.\nAWSGlueServiceRole\nAmazonS3FullAccess\nClick the \"Next\" button.\n2.4 Name, review, and create\nImportant: the role name must be exactly the name provide here. The description is optional.\nRole name:\ndvsum-glue-service-role\nRole Description: Role used by DvSum to grant the Glue Crawler permission to access files\nClick the \"Create role\" button.\nStep 3: Generate Access Key\n3.1 Navigate to Security Credentials\nNavigate to\nIAM → Access Management → Users\n. Select the user you just created, and click the \"Security credentials\" tab.\n3.2 Create Access Key\nClick the \"Create access key\" button.\nSelect \"Command Line Interface(CLI)\". Click the \"Next\" button.\n3.3 Add a description Tag\nA description for the access key is optional, but setting it is a best practice.\nDescription tag value: Access key used by DvSum to access S3, Athena, and Glue services\nClick the \"Create access key\" button.\n3.3 Retrieve access keys\nSave the Access key and Secret access keys. You will use these values when configuring the S3 data source in DvSum.\nNext Steps\nNow that you have an AWS Access Key associated with a user that has all required permissions, the next step is to follow the instructions on how to\nConfigure Amazon S3 as a Data Source in DvSum.\nCommand Line Instructions\nThe steps below achieve the same results as the detailed steps above using the AWS CLI.\n# Create a new user (use any valid name for the user)\naws iam create-user --user-name dvsum-user\n# Attach these 3 AWS managed policies\naws iam attach-user-policy \\\n--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonAthenaFullAccess \\\n--user-name dvsum-user\naws iam attach-user-policy \\\n--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess \\\n--user-name dvsum-user\naws iam attach-user-policy \\\n--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSGlueServiceRole \\\n--user-name dvsum-user\n# Create dvsum-s3-source-policy (Use this exact name)\naws iam create-policy \\\n--policy-name dvsum-s3-source-policy \\\n--policy-document \\\n'{\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\": [\n{\n\"Sid\": \"GetUserInfo\",\n\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\"Action\": [\n\"iam:GetUser\",\n\"iam:ListAttachedUserPolicies\",\n\"iam:PassRole\"\n],\n\"Resource\": [\n\"*\"\n]\n}\n]\n}'\n# Attach the policy (your policy-arn will be different from this example)\naws iam attach-user-policy \\\n--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/dvsum-s3-source-policy \\\n--user-name dvsum-user\n# Create role for crawler\naws iam create-role \\\n--role-name dvsum-glue-service-role \\\n--assume-role-policy-document \\\n'{\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\": [\n{\n\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\"Principal\": {\n\"Service\": \"glue.amazonaws.com\"\n},\n\"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n}\n]\n}'\n# Attach AWSGlueServiceRole policy to role\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n--role-name dvsum-glue-service-role \\\n--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSGlueServiceRole\n# Attach AmazonS3FullAccess policy to role\naws iam attach-role-policy \\\n--role-name dvsum-glue-service-role \\\n--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess\n# Create an access key\naws iam create-access-key --user-name dvsum-user",

    "content": "In This Article:\nOverview\nData Usage Statistics in Data Catalog\nUsage Classifications\nCapturing Data Usage Statistics\nEnable Query Logging (SQL Server / Azure)\nEnable Query Logging (PostgreSQL)\nQuery Logging in Other Sources\nOverview\nDvSum Data Catalog (DC) manages lots of information about data sets--from metadata like column definitions to governance information like the data owner and data steward to data classifications like 'restricted' vs 'public' and much more. Data sets include tables and views in relational data sources, reports in business intelligence platforms, and objects in other applications like SAP and Salesforce.\nOne piece of information that DC tracks about relational data sets (tables and views) is data usage metrics documenting how often the data set is accessed by users via SQL queries. Query logs are maintained by the underlying database, and these statistics are summarized in DC to help users to understand which data sets are used most frequently.\nThese data set usage statistics are tracked in a property called \"Popularity\". This article explains where popularity is available in DC and how to configure databases to allow DC to gather this information.\nData Usage Statistics in Data Catalog\nThe data popularity is displayed in several locations in DC:\nData Dictionary table view\nData Set popup window\nData Set details page\nSearch results for tables\nExamples of data popularity available in DC:\nUsage Classifications\n3 Stars - Heavily used\nTable is used daily over the last 30 days\n2 Stars - Moderately used\nTable is used at least weekly over the last 30 days\n1 Star - Lightly used\nTable is used less than once per week over the last 30 days\nIf no stars are displayed it means either DvSum is unable to read query logs or the table has not been accessed in the past 30 days.\nNote:\nThe popularity score is typically calculated for the last 30 days. The data retention policy for Snowflake tracks user query history for only 7 days. Keep in mind that retention policies and query logging details can be set differently by your corporate database administrators.\nExamples in DvSum Data Catalog (DC)\nData Dictionary table view\nNote: The field \"Popularity\" is an optional field, so add it to your view if it is not visible.\nData Set popup window\nData Set details page\nSearch results for tables\nNote: If search results have multiple tables with the same name, the table with the higher popularity score will be shown first.\nCapturing Data Usage Statistics in Data Sources\nEnable Query logging in SQL Server, A\nzure SQL, Azure Synapse\nUse the\nQuery Store\n.\nThe Query Store is enabled by default for new Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance databases.\nQuery Store is not enabled by default for SQL Server 2016 (13.x), SQL Server 2017 (14.x), SQL Server 2019 (15.x). It is enabled by default in the\nREAD_WRITE\nmode for new databases starting with SQL Server 2022 (16.x). To enable features to better track performance history, troubleshoot query plan related issues, and enable new capabilities in SQL Server 2022 (16.x), we recommend enabling Query Store on all databases.\nQuery Store is not enabled by default for new Azure Synapse Analytics databases.\nEnabling the Query Store can be done in multiple ways.\nEnable Query Store using the Query Store page in SQL Server Management Studio\nIn Object Explorer, right-click a database, and then select\nProperties\n.\nNote: Requires version 16 or later of Management Studio\nIn the\nDatabase Properties\ndialog box, select the\nQuery Store\npage.\nIn the\nOperation Mode (Requested)\nbox, select\nRead Write\n.\nEnable Query Store using Transact-SQL statements\nUse the\nALTER DATABASE\nstatement to enable the query store for a given database. For example:\nALTER DATABASE <database_name>\nSET QUERY_STORE = ON (OPERATION_MODE = READ_WRITE);\nIn Azure Synapse Analytics, enable the Query Store without additional options, for example:\nALTER DATABASE <database_name>\nSET QUERY_STORE = ON;\nEnable Query logging in PostgreSQL\nTo enable query logging in PostgreSQL, you can modify the configuration file (postgresql.conf) and use SQL statements for more fine-grained control.\nModify postgresql.conf\nYou need superuser privileges to edit this file.\nYou can locate\npostgresql.conf\nin your PostgreSQL data directory.\nCommon locations include:\n/etc/postgresql/<version>/main\n(Linux)\nC:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\<version>\\data\n(Windows)\nEdit\npostgresql.conf\nSet\nlogging_collector\nto '\non\n'\nSet\nlog_statement\nto 'all' to track SQL queries. For reference, these are the valid values:\nnone\n(default): Log no statements.\nddl\n: Log data definition language (DDL) statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.\nmod\n: Log moderate-level statements, including DDL and most of the data manipulation language (DML) statements.\nall\n: Log all statements, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and more.\nUse SQL Statements for Fine-Grained Control\nIf you want to enable or disable query logging for specific databases or sessions, you can use SQL statements. This can be especially useful for debugging or auditing purposes. You can change logging settings on a per-session or per-database basis using the following SQL commands:\nTo enable query logging for the current session only:\nSET log_statement = 'all';\nTo enable query logging for a specific database (replace your_database with the actual database name):\nALTER DATABASE your_database SET log_statement = 'all';\nTo disable query logging for a specific database:\nALTER DATABASE your_database SET log_statement = 'none';\nThese SQL statements will take effect immediately for the current session or database.\nRemember to be cautious with query logging in production environments, as it can generate large log files and potentially impact performance. Always monitor your log files and adjust the log level as needed to balance the need for more information and the need for better performance.\nQuery logging in other sources\nQuery logging is enabled by default for these databases, so DC will typically gather popularity statistics with no additional configuration needed.\nOracle\nSnowflake",

    "content": "In this Article:\nOverview\nScheduling a Scan Job\nConfigure Scheduler Settings\nScan Frequency Options\nDaily Scans\nWeekly Scans\nMonthly Scans\nEnd Conditions\nScan Summary\nVideo Tutorial\nOverview:\nJob schedulers automate and streamline the execution of tasks within web applications, ensuring timely and efficient processing of background jobs, thus enhancing overall system performance and user experience. In the Dvsum Data Catalog application, the scheduler plays a pivotal role in automating the data source scanning process. By setting predefined schedules, the scheduler ensures that scans occur without manual intervention, maintaining data accuracy and relevance. This automation optimizes resource utilization by enabling scans during off-peak hours, enhancing overall system efficiency. The automated scans also provide timely insights into data changes, allowing prompt identification of trends or anomalies.\nWithin the Data Catalog application, users are presented with two methods to initiate a scan. The first involves an immediate on-demand scan achieved by clicking the \"Scan now\" button on the data source's Scan History page.\nThe second option grants users the ability to schedule scans using a scheduler, a process that we will explore in more detail below.\nScheduling a Scan Job:\nNavigate to the Data Source general settings from the detail page. There, the user will see the Scanning Information section which has the scheduling details. By default, it is set to empty as shown below.\nConfigure Scheduler Settings:\nNavigate to Data Sources > Any Source > Settings > General\nIn order to configure scheduler settings, open the edit mode by clicking the \"\nEdit\n\" button. Within this mode, users will find and be able to adjust the desired scheduler settings as shown below.\nScan Frequency Options\nFirst of all, the user has to set the Scan Frequency. Click on the Scan Frequency field dropdown and it will show the following options:\nOne Time:\nThis will create and execute just one job on a selected date and time.\nDaily:\nThis will result in the creation and execution of jobs on a daily basis at a chosen time.\nWeekly:\nThis will create and execute jobs on a weekly basis at a chosen day, date, and time.\nMonthly:\nThis will create and execute jobs on a monthly basis at a chosen date, and time.\nNow from the \"\nStarts On\n\" field, select the Date and Time at which job(s) will be executed.\nDaily Scans:\nOnce the Daily scan frequency is set and the user selects the date and time of the frequency of the scan, the user can also set the day frequency at which job(s) will be scheduled and executed from the days dropdown as shown below.\nBy default, it is set as 1, which means jobs will be executed daily at the selected time. If the user selects it to 2 then jobs will be executed after every 2 days. If I start the scheduling on Monday and set the day frequency to 2, then jobs will be executed on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and so on every second day.\nIn addition to this, users have the option to repeat the task multiple times within a single day. To enable this feature, users need to click on the checkbox labeled \"Repeat tasks every.\" This action triggers additional text fields to appear, prompting the user to input the frequency in minutes and the total duration in hours for the task repetition. For instance, if a user enters 20 minutes for 1 hour and schedules it for 9:00 PM, a new task will be executed every 20 minutes. This means the initial task will start at 9:00 PM, followed by subsequent tasks at 9:20 PM, 9:40 PM, and concluding at 10:00 PM for the day.\nWeekly Scans:\nOnce the Weekly scan frequency is set and the user selects the date and time of the frequency of the scan, the user can also set the days on which that scan will be repeated. Days checkboxes will appear in the \"\nRepeat on\n\" field and whichever days the user selects, a new scan will be executed on those days at the desired time.\nMonthly Scans:\nOnce the Monthly scan frequency is set and the user selects the date and time of the frequency of the scan, the user can also choose to select the repetition of the scan. Once the Monthly scan option is selected, the \"\nRepeat by\n\" field will populate which will have two options \"\nDay of the month\n\" and \"\nDay of the week\n\". If \"\nDay of the month\n\" is selected, then a new job will be scheduled and executed on the selected date and time of every month.\nEnd Conditions:\nNow closing out the scheduling settings, select the end date/time of the scheduler from the \"\nEnds\n\" field. It has three options in the form of radio buttons which have the following purpose:\nNever:\nThis means that the jobs will always be running on the desired date and time which is set and it will never stop.\nAfter:\nThis means that after certain occurrences, jobs will stop getting auto-created and executed. The user has to enter a certain number of occurrences.\nOn:\nThis means that on a particular date that the user has selected, jobs will stop getting auto-created and executed.\nScan Summary:\nOnce all the settings are done, the Scan Summary will appear at the bottom as shown below. Save the General settings to start the execution of the scheduler.\nVideo Tutorial:\nWatch this quick video tutorial of how to s\nchedule a Job for Data Sources:",

While the Administration menu option is visible only to Admins, Editors. Users without Editor privileges cannot import.\nWhether you're working with system asset types (e.g., Glossary Terms, Data Dictionary, Analytics Dictionary, Fields & Lineage) or custom asset types, the Data Import functionality enables efficient population of the platform using structured Excel files.\nAdmins and Editors can import up to 50,000 records at a time using\n.xls\n,\n.xlsx\n, or\n.csv\nfile formats. This capability significantly reduces manual effort and accelerates the onboarding and management of metadata assets.\nLet’s explore how the Data Import process works in detail.\nSteps to Data import\nImportant:\nEnsure that the Domain and Sub-domain are created in the application before starting the import process. The import will use these as a reference when uploading data.\nStep 1: Starting the Import\nYou can start an import in two ways:\n1. From the Administration menu – Go to Administration → Data Import, select the Asset Type from the dropdown, and click Next.\n2. Directly from an asset view – Open the listing page for the asset you want to import (for example, Glossary Terms) and click the Import button at the top right. This method works for any supported asset type.\nStep 2: Preparing the Import File\nTo begin, download the sample file and fill in the data as per the instructions.\nImportant:\nField Dictionary Imports\n:\nThe Entity field must now include both the\nData Domain\nand\nSubdomain\nin the format:\nDD.SD.EntityName\nFor example:\nDefault.Default.US_PASSPORT\n.\nThis structure ensures each entity is uniquely identified during the import.\nMore information on above, refer to\nthis article\n.\nNote on Subdomain Handling\nThe Field Dictionary import template does not include a separate Subdomain column. Subdomain is not a required field in the Field Dictionary and is automatically inherited. A separate Subdomain column is available only in the Business Glossary import, where it is mandatory.\nAdditional Notes for Sample File:\nTags\n:\nThe\nTags\ncolumn in the sample file allows multiple tags to be added using the format\n{Tagset Name}={Tag}\n. Multiple tags can be separated by a comma. For example:\nData Classification=Public, Custom Tags=PKR\n.\nData Steward and Data Owner\n:\nThese fields in the sample file must contain valid email addresses of users already added in the DvSum tool.\nFor Glossary Terms file imports only\nThe\nTerm Type\ncolumn must contain one of the\neight predefined term types\n.\nThe applicability of\nBusiness Rules\n—such as Category Data Rule, Pattern Rule, Regex Pattern Rule, Value Range Rule, and Manual—depends on the selected\nTerm Type\n.\nIf the Term Type is Numerical\n:\nOnly\nValue Range Rule\nand\nManual\nare applicable.\nFor\nValue Range Rule\n, use the format:\n{Min Value} - {Max Value}\nExample\n:\n1 - 20\nIf the Term Type is Categorical Attribute\n:\nUse\nCategory Data Rule\nin the format:\n{Categories.Value 1}={Categories.Description}, {Categories.Value 2}={Categories.Description}\nIf the Term Type is Computed Measure\n:\nThe\nTerm Formula\nmust be provided in the same file.\nOnce the file is filled correctly,\nupload the sample file\nthrough the Data Import screen.\nBy default, the\n\"Update Existing Records\"\noption is enabled for\nData Dictionary\nimports, allowing you to update existing records during the import process.\nNote on Status\nIf you include a\nStatus\ncolumn in your import file, the import process validates the value to ensure it is recognized by the platform.\nStatus Values Recognized and Processed During Import\nIf you include a\nStatus\ncolumn in your import file, note the following:\nThe following Status values are\nrecognized and processed\nduring Data Import:\nPublished\nDraft\nModified\nWhen these supported values appear in the import file:\nThe import\ndoes not fail due to Status validation\nThe Status value is\naccepted and processed\naccording to the domain’s configuration (workflow or non-workflow)\nIf your file includes\nunsupported or invalid status values\n, such as:\nDeleted\nNew\nSuggested\nDefault\nAny custom status\nThen:\nThe import will\nfail for those records\nThe import view will\nnot accept those rows\nThe summary report will display the remark:\nStatus has Invalid data\nThis validation helps ensure only valid and supported Status values are processed during import.\nImportant Notes\nYou\ndo not need to include\na Status column in the import template. The system will assign the correct status automatically.\nIf included, the Status column should only contain values recognized by the platform. Any other value will cause the row to fail validation.\nImage: Existing Import Status Table Example\nCaption: Import view showing records with different status outcomes.\nExample: Summary Report for Invalid Status\nCaption: Summary report showing failed record due to unsupported Status value (\"Deleted\") with remark \"Status has Invalid data\".\nExample: Email Notification of Import Failure\nCaption: Email notification from DvSum indicating that the import failed due to invalid data.\nImporting/Updating values for Custom Attributes\nThe Data Import process also supports importing values for custom attributes. Any custom attributes applied to an asset type should be added as a column in the downloadable import templates.\nMove the required custom attribute column from\nAvailable\nto\nAssigned\nso that it appears in the view, allowing users to download the template and populate values for those attributes.\nTo import custom attribute values:\nDownload the import template for the asset type.\nLocate the custom attribute columns (these are added dynamically based on the attributes applied to that asset).\nEnter the values in the respective custom attribute columns.\nUpload the completed template through the Data Import tool.\nExample:\nIf a custom attribute called “Credit Card Number” is applied to your assets, the template will include a “Credit Card Number” column. Filling in this column with values that match the defined format (e.g., 16-digit numbers like\n1234-5678-9012-3456\n) will assign the values to the correct assets once the import is processed.\nAfter entering the values, follow the same steps to import.\nNote:\nValues that do not match the required format (defined when creating the custom attribute) will not be accepted.\nFor more details on creating and managing custom attributes, refer\nCreating and Managing Custom Attributes.\nExcel (.xlsx) File Requirements\nWhen importing data using an Excel (\n.xlsx\n) file, ensure the file is clean before uploading.\nThe Excel file must contain\nonly one worksheet\n.\nAny formatting applied to rows beyond the actual data records must be removed.\nRows that appear empty but contain formatting are treated as records during import.\nNote:\nFailure to meet these requirements may result in additional or incorrect records being imported.\nStep 2.1: Download and Reuse Data for Import\nUsers can also download data from the listing page and import the downloaded file using Data import:\nStep 3: Field Mapping\nFields from the uploaded file will get mapped with Field in dvsum. Mapped Tab will show all fields which are mapped. Once All Required Fields are mapped. Users can Click on\nImport\nbutton and start import\nIf a field is unmapped, the user can map it individually by selecting the appropriate option from the dropdown available in the Fields section under the DvSum column. Similarly, to remove a single field, the user can click the remove icon provided for that field.\nFor bulk actions, the user can utilize the\nReset Field Mapping\nand\nApply Auto Mapping\nbuttons.\nStep 4: Import Completion\nA success screen will be shown to the user when the file is imported successfully.\nI'm Done\nButton will redirect the user to the Data import step1.\nGo to Assets Dictionary\nbutton will redirect the user to the Assets dictionary listing page with respective Asset Type.\nStep 5: Import Summary Email\nAfter 3-5 minutes the user will receive an email with a complete summary of imported Data. Users can also download the summary of uploaded data using the Download button.\nStep 6: Post-Import Actions (Domain-Specific)\nAfter completing the import,\nrecords are not automatically published\n.\nPlease follow these additional steps to publish your records. The post-import steps vary depending on whether your domain has a workflow enabled or not.\nPost-Import Actions – Workflow-Enabled Domains\nPost-Import Actions – Non-Workflow Domains\nPlease refer to the relevant guide to complete your import process appropriately.",

    "content": "Introduction\nCatalog Tables and Datasets/Reports can be scanned and edited using an approval workflow in the DvSum Data Catalog. Approval workflows are configured for each data sub-domain. When an approval workflow is configured, then Data Stewards are able to edit the tables and datasets/reports and submit the changes for approval. Approvers are then able to approve or reject the updates. The Approval flow already exists in the case of Business Glossary Terms. You can click\nhere\nif you would like more information about the Glossary Approval flow.\nPrerequisites\n1. An administrator must enable data governance.\nAdministration → Account → Module Settings → Governance\n2. Data domains should already be defined.\nThe approval workflows will be defined for a data domain.\nLet's check the step-by-step guide on how this functionality works. So, first of all, we will be adding the data domain and then attaching the data domain to a table or catalog/report.\nAdding a Domain:\nGo to the Administration tab, and select \" Organizations\", and then choose \"Data Domains\" from the dropdown. On the domain listing page, click the\nAdd\nbutton.\nOn Add Domain form provide the Domain name, Description, and Data Steward. And then click on the \"\nEnable Workflow\n\" checkbox.\nThis will enable the workflow for this particular domain. Choose the approvers: There can be single or multiple approvers. Further, choose the workflow type, either \"\nAnyone can approve\n\" or \"\nAll need to approve\n\".\nClick on the Save button, and the domain will be saved. In the listing, it can be seen that the newly added domain will appear on the top with an icon that represents this domain has workflow enabled as shown below.\nThe steward who is selected while creating the Domain will be the one who will be editing the table/dataset/reports and making the changes. Then, changes will be sent for approval to the approver(s). The approver's job will be to review the changes made by the Steward and approve or reject them.\nWorkflow for Tables\nWorkflow can be enabled for Tables by attaching a Domain for which workflow was enabled. Users can add data domain by going on to the detail page of the table from data dictionary tab:\nThe Data domain can be added to the table by clicking on \"Edit,\" which opens the Edit mode of the table. The Data domain for which workflow is enabled should be added in order for the workflow process to be started:\nNote: The Domain for which workflow is enabled will have the workflow symbol in front of it\nOnce the Domain is added, the changes will be needed to publish so that the domain is now attached to the table:\nOnce the changes are published for the workflow to be initiated user is required to edit the table and make any changes in the table once the change is made then in order to publish the change, the table would be required to be published by the approver.\nOnce the changes are made, the user can click on the \"Done\" button. After clicking \"Done,\" there will be an option of \"Submit for Approval\". Once the user clicks \"Submit for Approval,\" then the workflow process can be initiated, and the table will be submitted for approval.\nThe Submitter has the option of Cancelling the submission or otherwise waiting from the approver's end.\nThe approver will receive an email once the table is submitted for approval:\nOn the Approver's screen, the approver can \"Review changes\" that have been made by the submitter.\nAll the fields will appear, and the edited ones will show up as highlighted.\nIf the approver wants to reject the changes, then the \"\nReject\n\" button can be clicked. It will ask the user to add a reason for rejection as a comment. The changes will get rejected.\nTo approve the changes, the user needs to click on the \"\nApprove\n\" button, and the changes that the Steward made will be approved, and the term will get Published.\nSubmitting/Approving multiple Tables using Mass Update:\nIf there are more tables to be submitted for approval, then the user can submit them all for approval at once by using mass update:\nNote: In order to initiate the workflow from listing first tables should have the workflow domain and must be edited (change the data domain, add entity from mass update, or add tags).\nOnce the Tables are submitted for approval, the approver can approve multiple tables as well at once from the Mass update. Go to the Data Dictionary listing again, and there will be a tab \"Assigned to me,\" which will show all the tables that are assigned to the logged-in approver.\nFrom the \"Assigned to me\" tab, select the tables and click on mass update and from the mass update modal, click on the status field and select \"\nApprove\n\" and apply. This will approve all the selected tables. That's how the approver can approve multiple tables at once.\nWorkflow for DQ Rules\nWorkflow for DQ Rules is automatically applied to any Rule associated with a Table that belongs to a Data Domain where workflow functionality is enabled. This ensures that any modifications to DQ Rules follow a controlled approval process, maintaining data governance and change auditability across governed domains.\nFor Tables or DQ Rules that belong to a workflow-enabled Data Domain, a workflow symbol appears on both the Database Table and DQ Rule tabs..\nThe newly created rule can be executed in either\nOnline\nor\nOffline\nmode where both the\nData Steward\nand\nData Owner\ncan initiate the rule execution.\nAfter initial creation, the Steward can modify the rule definition by selecting\nEdit option\n. Changes can be made on the  Rule Definition (Overview), Thresholds, and Workflow. However, any changes made to a workflow-enabled rule require\napprover authorization\nbefore being published.\nFor Example:\nWhen changes are made to the Rule Definition, the\nSubmit for Approval\noption automatically appears.\nOnce all modifications are complete, select Submit for Approval to initiate the workflow process.\nThe rule then enters the approval stage.\nOn the DQ Rule > Overview page, the submitter can view the current workflow status.\nAt this stage, the submitter can either Cancel the Submission or wait for the approver’s response.\nApproval Process\nOnce a rule is submitted for approval, the approver receives an email notification indicating that the DQ Rule is awaiting review.\nThe approver can click Review Changes to view all modifications made by the submitter. All updated fields are highlighted for easier comparison.\nIf the approver decides to reject the changes, the Reject option can be selected. A reason for rejection must be entered as a comment. Once rejected, the submission is discarded, and the rule remains in its previous state.\nTo approve the changes, click Approve. The updates made by the Data Steward are then accepted, and the DQ Rule is published.\nWorkflow for Dataset/Reports\nDatasets and Reports can be found on the BI Models and reports tab, and just like the tables for the workflow to be started, a data domain for which workflow is enabled should be added for the dataset or report:\nOnce the workflow domain is added, the user will be required first to publish the changes and then again edit the dataset/report to initiate the workflow:\nOnce the Dataset/Report is submitted for approval, user can see the workflow on the top right, and email will be received by the approver about the dataset/report that is sent for approval:\nThe approver can \"Compare changes\" for the dataset/report and afterward approve or reject the dataset or report. Once the approver approves the dataset/report, the dataset/report will be published\nJust like the Tables, if there are more than one dataset/reports then they can be submitted for approval through the mass update, and the approver can accept the dataset/report through the mass update:\nSubmitter's account\nApprover's account\nThe overall functionality of the workflow is the same for Tables, Datasets, and reports, so for that reason, the dataset/report part is not covered like the Tables part.\nHow to check the Activities history of the Tables/Reports/Datasets?\nOn the Table/Report/Dataset detail page \"\nManaged by\n\" section, there will be a chat icon. Click on that, and it will show all the history of activities that have been performed on the table/report/dataset. Comments can also be added to the table/report/dataset activity.",

Data domains and sub-domains should already be defined. The approval workflows will be defined for a data sub-domain.\nLet's check the step-by-step guide on how this functionality works. So, first of all, we will be adding the data domain, sub-domain, and then finally the term.\nFor detailed information on adding data domain and sub-domain refer article\n\"Data Domains & Data Sub-Domains\"\nAdding a New Term\nFrom the left navigation bar select\nDictionaries >Glossary\nTerms\nwhich will navigate to the terms listing page. From the listing click on the \"Add Asset\" button.\nFrom the Add Term modal, select the same sub-domain that we created above. Enter the Name, Title, and Description, and select the Term Type. Click on the Save button and the term will be saved redirecting the user to the term detail page.\nOn the term detail page, it can be seen that this newly created term is in the draft status. The term will only get published once it is submitted for approval and gets approved.\nNote:\nThe terms in the Draft state will not appear in enterprise search results. Only Published terms will appear in enterprise search.\nAt the top of the Term detail page, the workflow stages will appear. Currently, it will be in the first stage as Steward would need to make some changes.\nNow below is the Steward's view which they can edit in this term. The below image shows that the Steward has changed the definition.\nTo edit a term, click on the \"Edit\" button. Click on the pencil icon for whichever section needs to be edited. Once changes are made to the particular field, click on the circular check mark button on the same section and then the Done button.\nOnce the Steward edits the term, then the \"\nSubmit for Approval\n\" button needs to be clicked which will send the term for approval to the approver.\nOnce the Steward submits the term for approval, the workflow will move to the second stage which will show the pending approval status along with the approver's name as shown below\nNow next step is for Approver who needs to review the changes made by the Steward. The below image shows the approver's screen.\nClick on the \"\nCompare Changes\n\" button to review the changes that have been made. All the fields will appear and the edited ones will show up as highlighted.\nIf the approver wants to reject the changes, then the \"\nReject\n\" button can be clicked. It will ask the user to add a reason for rejection as a comment. The changes will get rejected.\nTo approve the changes, the user needs to click on the \"\nApprove\n\" button, and the changes that were made by the Steward will be approved and the term will get Published.\nApproving multiple Terms using Mass Update\nOther than that, Approver can approve multiple terms as well at once from the Mass update.

That's how the approver can approve multiple terms at once.\nHow to check the Activities history of the term?\nOn the term detail page \"\nManaged by\n\" section, there will be a chat icon. Click on that and it will show all the history of activities that have been performed on the term. Comments can also be added to the term activity.\nWorkflow for Assets\nFor any asset associated with a workflow-enabled data domain, if the Data Steward makes changes to the asset, the\nSubmit for Approval\nbutton must be clicked. This action sends the asset to the designated approver for validation and approve.\nAfter the Steward submits the asset for approval, the workflow status is displayed at the top of the asset detail page, indicating\nPending Approval\nalong with the approver’s name, as shown below..\nApprover Review\nThe next step is for the Approver to review the changes made by the Steward. The image below shows the Approver’s view.\nClick the\nCompare Changes\nbutton to review the modifications. All fields will be displayed, with any edited fields highlighted for easy identification.\nTo reject the changes, the Approver can click the\nReject\nbutton. A prompt will appear to provide a reason for the rejection as a comment, and the changes will then be declined.\nTo approve the changes, click the\nApprove\nbutton. The modifications made by the Steward will be approved, and the asset will be published.\nApproving multiple Assets using Mass Update\nThe Approver can also approve multiple assets at once using the\nMass Update\nfeature. On the asset listing page, the\nAssigned to Me\ntab displays all assets assigned to the logged-in Approver.\nFrom the\nAssigned to Me\ntab, select the desired assets and click\nMass Update\n.\nIn the\nMass Update\nmodal, click the\nStatus\nfield, select\nApprove\n, and then click\nApply\n. This action will approve all the selected assets, allowing the Approver to process multiple assets at once.\nVideo Tutorial\nWatch this\nTutorial\nto understand the Glossary Security Flow in which the following points are discussed:\n1. Enable Workflow for Sub-Domain\n2. Add New Term and Submit for Approval\n3. Approve the Term\n4. Edit the Term and submit for Approval again\n5. Compare changes and Approve the term\n6.

    "content": "In this Article:\nIntroduction\nViewing Execution Progress\nSample Questions\nDetailed Questions\nProfiling & Filtering\nSaving the Question as Context\nGenerating Answers Based on Different Tools\nBasic CRUD Operations\nLeft Navigation Bar\nIntroduction\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in data analysis by providing a simple interface to extract insights from large and complex data sets. With its ability to process natural language quickly, AI helps people make better-informed decisions, identify patterns and trends, and uncover hidden insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. In DvSum users can talk to their data using\nC\nonversational\nA\nI for\nD\nata-\nD\nriven\nI\nnsights (CADDI). DvSum CADDI is a user-friendly platform where users can ask different questions from their datasets and extract useful insights. The following article explains how CAADI chat can be used.\nThis article is linked to Agents. For more information on Agents, click\nConfiguring CADDI - Creating Agents\n.\nHow to talk to the data in DvSum Data Catalog:\nBefore we start chatting with data, first, we need to create a agent and share it with some users.  Here I have a agent shown below, which I have shared with the user. On the agent go to \"Manage Access\" and share the agent with any user.\nOnce the agent is shared,\nclick on \"Talk to Your Data\" from the left Nav. It will open the Conversational page on a new tab.\nNow in the Conversational tab, all the agents that are shared with some users will appear as agents. So we need to select some agent to start the conversation. I'm selecting the agent which I shared above.\nOnce the agent is selected, an About section of that chat will appear on the new chat, which will contain details of the agent i.e. the tables that were added to the agent .\nViewing Execution Progress\nWhen a question is executed in CADDI Chat, a\nprogress indicator\nappears showing the following four steps of processing:\nUnderstanding the question\n– The query is interpreted, language detected, and validated for clarity.\nIdentification of relevant tables\n– CADDI determines which tables contain the required data.\nCrafting SQL query\n– A SQL query is generated to ensure accurate and relevant data retrieval.\nExplanation of how the query works\n– The system explains the query logic, including filters, joins, and calculations.\nAfter execution, the\nfinal output and query explanation\nare displayed, offering transparency into how the results were derived.\nOn clicking the book icon located on the top right of the chat bar, some sample questions show up. Users can use these questions for analysis:\nOn the CADDI, two types of questions can be asked which are:\nSample Question\nDetailed Question\nSample Questions\nClick on the \"Sample Data\" button, and it will show the sample data of that data set. The Sample question will not have any SQL code generated, and there will be no visualized charts for it. The Sample Data will have the Pivot View.\nFrom the sample data, users can have some basic insights into what data is about and what it looks like. Users can select different columns and apply filters to check the results.\nUsers can see the profiling of the different columns in sample questions by simply clicking on the column heading in the grid:\nUsers can apply some filters and set up that question as a context also by clicking on the context icon:\nNote: For Sample Questions, context can only be set up when some filter is selected\nThe Concept of Profiling and Context will be explained further in this article.\nDetailed Questions\nA detailed question is one for which:\nSQL Code is generated\nVisualized Grid, Charts and Pivot Information is generated\nContext can be set up, and Profiling Information is available\nSQL Query\nWhen the question is asked about any dataset, then for that question, SQL code is generated, it can be seen when users select the \"Show Code\" option below the answer output:\nDifferent Generated Views\nFor the question that is not typed, 3 different views are generated which are:\nChart View (located next to Chart Settings)\nGrid View\nPivot View\nThe Chart View, Chart Settings, and Pivot View are separate detailed topics, and they are not included in the scope of this article. For additional information, you can visit the articles below:\nChart Settings in CADDI\nPivot Tables in CADDI\nThe Grid View shows the data in tabular form of the columns that are fetched from the SQL query:\nAlong with the 3 different views there will be a gear icon of Settings which is present when this is clicked settings tab opens up with further three options:\nGeneral\nChart (Learn more in\nChart Settings in CADDI\n)\nField (Explained in Profiling & Filtering below)\nThe General tab contains the toggle button of \"Human readable format\". By default, this option is turned off:\nWhen this option is turned on then it helps in better reading of the data. For example, if there are large values like in thousands or millions then it will show in a much more readable format:\nProfiling & Filtering\nProfiling shows the distribution of different values of a column which helps in a better understanding of the data. Users can apply filters on the Grid through profiling by selecting particular values. The profiling of any column is opened by clicking the column heading in the grid. When the profiling of any column is opened then the \"Settings ---> Field\" tab is opened up.\nWhen no column is selected and from \"Show settings\", the \"Field\" option is selected then no profiling of the column will be shown. Instead, it will show this:\n2.3.1- Date type column\nFor any date type column user can set different date formats according to the requirement.\nOnce any date format is selected then in the grid that particular date format will be applied:\nNote: When any date format is selected then it applies to every question that was previously asked or will be asked\nThe Grid can be filtered from the visual distribution section. A handle is provided which helps in applying filters according to different values. Once the values are selected then the grid on the left will be filtered accordingly:\nDecimal type column\nThe Profiling of any column that has the data type can be opened by just clicking on the column heading in the grid. The difference is that there are some additional changes provided in its profiling. Users have the option to set decimal values after the point according to the requirement:\nFilters can be applied from the visual distribution section. For this particular example, the handle is not present below the distribution bars because if the distinct values for the columns are less than 20 then there will be no handle provided, users can click on the bars to fill in \"Minimum\" and \"Maximum\" values.\nInteger type column\nThe Profiling can be opened by clicking on the column heading. For the columns having data type there are no additional options, there will be just visual distribution present from where \"Minimum\" and \"Maximum\" values can be selected:\nHere in the above example, the handle is provided below the distribution bars because, for this particular column, the distinct count exceeds 20. The logic that handle should be present or not is the same for columns having data type \"Decimal\" and \"Integer\".\nString type column\nThe Profiling can be opened similarly by just clicking on the column heading present in the grid. The visual distribution for the string-type columns is a little different from other data types. Filters can be applied by selecting different bars and on the grid the filters will be applied accordingly:\nSaving the Question as Context\nThe question that is asked that can be added as context or\nany specific filter applied on the grid can also be added from the Context icon on the top right of the question:\nThe added context can be seen on the top left of the chat bar below. Users can add more than one context from different datasets. If the context is no longer needed, then it can be removed from Clear Context.\nNext Time when any question related to the dataset is added as context this context will be incorporated into the questions also:\nGenerating Answers Based on Different Tools\nOften times users will require some questions to be answered in a visualized form and there would be scenarios where users would want just typed answers. For this purpose before asking a question user can select the tool that will generate the answer based on the selected tool. The three tools are located at the top right of the chat bar:\nThere are 3 different types of Tools that can be selected before writing up any question:\nSQL Query Tool\nData Understanding Tool\nGeneral Knowledge Tool\nSQL Query Tool\nBy default when any CADDI chat is opened the selected tool is the \"SQL Query tool\":\nWhen the selected tool is \"SQL Query Tool\" then when the user asks a question from any dataset then for that answer, SQL code and answer in visualized form (Charts and Grid) will be given:\nData Understanding Tool\nThe Data Understanding Tool can be used where the user wants some information about some columns present in the dataset e.g. range of values or different distributions of column. In this tool SQL Code and Visualized Grid will only be generated if necessary otherwise the answer is usually given in typed form where visualization is not required:\nGeneral Knowledge Tool\nThis tool can be used if the user wants to ask questions that are not related to the datasets present in the Data Catalog application. Any sort of general knowledge questions can be asked by using this tool. One use case of this tool can be for example there are some definitions for some columns for a particular dataset but user wants to know the industrial definition then this tool can be handy. This tool is located next to the Data Understanding tool:\nBasic CRUD Operations\nOn the top left of the Chat, where the name is written, some basic crud operations can be performed:\nUpdate Chat Name & Objective\nRefresh Insights\nDelete Chat\nCollapse All/Expand All Questions\nThe Chat Name can be updated by clicking on the \"Edit\" icon. Users can update the chat name as well as the objective for that chat:\nThe \"Refresh Insights\" button will refresh all the questions present in the chat:\nThe \"Delete\" button will delete the Chat and all the questions that are asked in it:\nThe \"Expand All/Collapse All\" will expand and collapse all the questions present on the chat:\nOn the top left of the chat bar, the agent that is opened will be shown. When a user clicks on it the view is expanded, and all the agents that are shared are shown here. Users can switch from one agent to another:\nLeft Navigation Bar\nWhen any agent is opened, if \"New Chat\" is clicked, then it takes to the Default CADDI window. Users can also scroll around the agents that were created:\nThe \"Find Data\" tab opens up the Home page of the Application on a new tab, and the \"Logout\" tab logs out of the Application:\nChat Preferences\nBelow the \"Find Data\" tab there will be a \"Chat Preferences\" tab. A modal opens up when \"My Preferences\" is clicked.\nUsers have the flexibility to configure a wide range of settings according to their preferences, allowing them to tailor the generated insights to their specific needs and requirements.\nNote:\nFor more details, refer\n\"How to talk to your data\".",

    "content": "Table of Contents\nOverview\nTypes of Questions Supported\nIntent Logic and Processing Chains\nAnalysis Chain Flow\nQA Chain Flow\nAction Chain Flow\nData Elements Extracted from Questions\nAction Execution and Agentic Tools\nSupported Actions\nOverview\nCADDI agents are designed to understand different types of user questions and respond appropriately based on intent. Depending on how a question is phrased, the agent may analyze customer data, answer a general question, or perform a system action.\nThis article explains the types of questions supported, how intent is evaluated, and when each processing chain is used.\nTypes of Questions Supported\nCADDI agents support the following types of user questions.\nCustomer-specific questions that include a unique identifier (e.g. customer ID).\nGeneral or follow-up questions related to a domain or previous conversation.\nRequests to perform actions such as resetting a modem or creating a Jira ticket.\nThe agent determines how to handle each question by evaluating intent flags.\nIntent Logic and Processing Chains\nIntent logic is defined within the agent configuration and controls how incoming questions are routed. Based on the detected intent, the agent selects one of three processing chains.\nAnalysis Chain Flow\nThe analysis chain is used for customer-specific data analysis.\nWhen this chain is used\nThis chain is selected when the question contains a unique identifier. which are values. The question may also consist only of the unique identifier.\nRules\nIf no unique identifier is detected, this chain must not be used. This chain focuses on analyzing customer data across connected systems and does not perform actions.\nExample inputs\nAnalyze\n<unique identifier>\nWhat issue is being faced by\n<unique identifier>\nQA Chain Flow\nThe QA chain is used for general questions and follow-up queries.\nWhen this chain is used\nThis chain is selected when no unique identifier is present, no action is requested, and the question is informational or refers to previous conversation context.\nExample inputs\nWhat does HFC mean in the telecom context?\nCan you identify the issue affecting customer\n<unique identifier>\nand suggest appropriate actions?\nAction Chain Flow\nThe action chain is used when a user explicitly asks the agent to perform an action.\nWhen this chain is used\nThis chain is selected when the user requests execution of a task that involves a real-world operation or a system update. If the request is a follow-up to a previous interaction, the agent internally rephrases the question to ensure the action is executed correctly.\nWhen an action is triggered, the agent executes one action at a time and verifies the outcome before proceeding. If additional steps are required, the agent confirms the result and asks the user how they would like to continue.\nExample actions\nCreate a Jira ticket.\nReset modem.\nCheck modem status.\nUpdate CRM database.\nData Elements Extracted from Questions\nTo process requests correctly, the agent extracts specific data elements from user questions.\nRequired data elements\nA unique identifier represents an identifier for a telecom customer.\nThe agent can extract a minimum of one data element and multiple data elements as needed, based on the user’s question.\nExample\nFor questions that require specific analysis, a unique identifier must be included in the request. This identifier allows the agent to identify the correct entity and retrieve the relevant data. Without it, the agent responds at a general level.\nAction Execution and Agentic Tools\nActions performed by the agent are enabled through\nAgentic Tools\n.\nThese tools define what actions the agent can perform and how those actions interact with external systems such as APIs and databases.\nAgentic Tools are built on predefined connections and commands. Connections define how the agent securely communicates with external systems, while commands define the specific actions that can be executed, such as rebooting a modem, checking modem status, updating customer records, or creating support tickets.\nEach agentic tool includes details such as the tool name, purpose, required inputs, connector type, and execution method. Tools may interact with systems through API-based integrations or database operations, depending on the nature of the action.\nActions are executed only when explicitly requested by the user and follow controlled execution and verification logic to ensure safe and predictable behavior.\nSupported Actions\nThe agent supports multiple predefined actions, including resetting a modem, checking modem status, creating Jira tickets, and updating CRM databases.\nEach action is executed only when explicitly requested and follows strict execution and verification rules.",

    "content": "Chat Preferences\nThe Chat Preferences option is available in the General Settings, allowing users to configure various settings that will impact the generated insights.\nNavigate to My Settings from the top right corner.\nSelect \"Chat Preference\" from My settings page\nDefault Answer View\n:\nWithin these settings, users can specify their preferred default view for generated insights: either\nChart\nview or Table view. Note that if the data set cannot be displayed in a chart, then it will fall back to a table view of the data.\nDefault Chart Sorting\n:\nIn the Default Chart Sorting settings, users have the option to set the default sorting order for generated insights on charts. They can choose between Ascending or Descending order, which will determine how charts are sorted by default. The image below shows these Default Chart Sorting.\nBy default, the Descending option will be set for users, which can be changed at any time. If the user selects the Ascending option, the chart will be sorted in Ascending order as shown below.\nAscending option was selected and settings were saved\nChart shows up sorted in Ascending order on first Y-Axis\nIf the user selects the Descending option, then the chart will be sorted in descending order as shown below.\nChart shows up sorted in Descending order on first Y-Axis\nConditions under which Default Chart Sorting works\n:\nThere are certain conditions under which this default sorting will work. These default chart sortings will only apply to those questions for which the bar chart shows up by default and the generated query of the question doesn't have the Order By clause. Note that the bar chart will be sorted based on the first Y-axis which is Y1 axis. However, if a chart has been modified by the user, such as changing the sorting or altering the X or Y axis, then the default sorting will be removed.\nThese default sorting settings do not apply to line charts, as sorting is automatically applied to the time series column on the X-axis by default for line charts. Additionally, if a question displays a bar chart by default but the generated query includes an Order By clause, the default sorting settings will not apply to that question\nDefault Answer Outputs\n:\nIn the default answer output, users can specify their preferred output settings, including '\nShow Log\n', '\nShow Code\n', and '\nShow Explanation\n'. By default, admins have 'Show Code' and 'Show Explanation' enabled, while other users default to 'Show Explanation' only.\nWithin these settings, users can select different Answer outputs. If a user toggles on the 'Show Log' option and saves the settings, logs will subsequently appear for each newly asked question.\nOnly log details are displayed for the question.\nIf a user wants the Query block to appear by default with insights, they can toggle on the 'Show Code' option\nOnly the Query code is displayed.\nLikewise, if a user prefers the Query Explanation to appear by default for each answer, they can toggle on the 'Show Explanation' option.\nOnly Query Explanation is displayed.\nAny changes made in the \"Chat Preferences\" will require the user to save the changes at the end.\nRegardless of the settings chosen for Default Answer outputs, users can hide/show Logs, Query code, and Query Explanation at the individual question level. This means that users can adjust these settings for each specific question as per their need, without affecting the default settings. For example, even if Code is set to appear by default according to the chat preferences, a user can choose to hide Code for a particular question if desired. These changes are specific to each question and do not impact the settings for other questions or the default settings.\nThis chat preference page is also available in the Talk to Your Data interface.\nThe chat preferences pages in both 'My settings' and 'Talk to Your Data' are synchronized.",

    "content": "In this Article:\nOverview\nAdding context to the questions\nRemoving the added context\nOverview\nIn this article, we'll be covering how we can use contexts in the questions that we ask in CADDI. Adding the context will have a significant impact on our data analysis and insights. Let's discover more about the context in detail.\nWhat is the importance of Contexts and how does it impact the insights which are generated s\nubsequently\n?\nWhen a user adds some context, the system stores this information. Subsequently, when a new question is asked, the system seamlessly integrates the contextual input into the generated queries, facilitating the generation of insights aligned with the provided context. This will help users get more precise insights from the data, contributing to an enhanced data analysis experience.\nAdding context to the questions\nClick on the \"Saved Contexts\" button which is located just underneath the Question text field as shown below.\nOnce the button is clicked, the Context panel will open from the right side of the screen. From that panel click on the \"Add Context\" button which will open up a text field where context can be added.\nThe example below shows the context that is added. Users can also add multiple contexts. Click on the Save button and the context will be saved.\nFrom there on whatever question is asked, will incorporate the saved context. The below example shows how added context is used in the generated query\nResults and insights as shown below are presented in alignment with the user's context.\nQuestions can also be used as a context. After a question is asked, click on the context button located with the actions buttons of the question.\nAfter clicking the context button, the selected question will be added as a context. If any filters are applied from the grid view using profiling, these filters will also be incorporated into the context after the question is set as the context.\nNote\n: Users can add multiple contexts.\nRemoving the added context\nThe user has the option to remove a single context or clear all contexts. If a single context is to be removed, simply click on the cross icon located with each context as shown below.\nOnce it is clicked, that context will be removed from the \"Context in Use\" section but it will still appear in the \"Saved Context\" section as shown below.\nAn essential point to note is that only the contexts in the \"Context in Use\" section are active and will be included in the upcoming questions. Contexts that show up in the \"Saved Context\" section are only there to be added back to the active contexts section if needed.\nThe other option to remove the existing context from the \"Context in Use\" section is by clicking on the \"Clear Context\" button, it will remove all the contexts and move them to the \"Saved Context\" section.",

    "content": "In this Article\nIntroduction\nPivot View\nRow Groups\nValues\nColumn Labels\nIntroduction\nImagine that you have a dataset that contains some numerical values, and you want to know the sum of a column, the maximum value of a column, or the minimum value of a column. Then, for every answer, you are required to ask different questions on Agent.  Now, instead of asking different questions about maximum value, minimum value, or sum, if you can get all the answers in one place, then it can save a lot of time. This Article explains how Pivot View can be of great help. Now, for this article, you should have the know-how of Agents. The Article on Agents can be found here:\nConfiguring CADDI - Creating Agents.\nPivot View\nWhen any question is asked on Agent from any dataset, there are different views generated, which are:\nChart View\nGrid View\nPivot View\nOur Focus in this article will be related to Pivot View only. The Pivot view can be found next to the Grid View:\nBefore analyzing the pivot view, let us see the grid view so we can see the data that has been brought up in the answer. The Grid View button is located to the left of the Pivot View button.\nIn the Grid, we have Transaction Amounts and Different Transactions. Now, Imagine that for different Transaction Names, I want to know the sum of the Transaction amount or maximum value, so for that, we will be required to ask different questions. Pivot View solves this problem.\nWhen Pivot View is opened, then on top, we have the search bar and the columns that are fetched for that question:\nBelow that, we have 3 options which are:\nRow Groups\nValues\nColumn Groups\nRow Groups\nIn the Row Groups, the columns that will be added will be shown as rows on the left side. The columns can be dragged from the dots present before the column name. In the Row groups, metric columns can not come under the Row Groups\nValues\nUnder the \"Values,\" only metric columns are allowed to be dragged. Metric columns are the columns whose data type is double, int, or decimal. Example of these types of columns is the amount, cost revenue, etc.\nIf dots are clicked on the columns under \"Values,\" then there are multiple options like sum, average, count, max, min, etc. In this way, the user can shift between them, and the grid on the left side will be changed accordingly:\nHere, in one place, the user can view the average, sum, minimum value, and maximum value of a metric instead of typing 3 to 4 different questions.\nColumn Labels\nJust like in Row groups where we added columns as rows, in the column labels, columns added here will be added on top as columns:\nNow, here for different dates and Transaction Names, the user can see the average, maximum, minimum, count, etc. of the transaction amount. That is how Pivot view saves the users from asking multiple questions. All of that information can be seen here. One thing is to be noted: just like Row Groups, metric columns are also not allowed to be dragged here.\nThe Pivot View is provided in both Agents and on CADDI chat. For more information on Agents and CADDI chat their articles can be found here:\nConfiguring CADDI - Creating Agents\nCADDI Chat (Talk to your Data)\n.\nThe example explained in this article is a simple one. Users can customize the pivot view according to their requirements.",

    "content": "In this Article:\nCharts in CADDI\nCharts Settings\nHuman-readable format\nAttributes & Dates section\nMetric Fields section\nCharts in CADDI\nPresenting data in charts or graphical forms enhances understanding and analysis. Visual representations simplify complex information, allowing users to grasp trends, patterns, and outliers quickly. This visual approach fosters more efficient decision-making and enables deeper insights from the data. In CADDI we show data results in the form of charts so that users can have more valuable insights of the data.\nWithin CADDI, three distinct chart types are available: Bar charts, Line charts, and Tile charts. When working with data results that include a Datetime column, the Line chart will be the default visualization, providing insights into temporal trends. Conversely, when the dataset lacks a Datetime column, the Bar chart will be automatically generated, aiding in the visualization of categorical comparisons. The Tile chart, a specialized representation, will exclusively manifest when the data output consists of a singular row and column intersection. Refer to the images below for a visual representation of each chart type.\nLine chart\nBar chart\nTile chart\nCharts Settings\nBoth Line and Bar charts feature customizable settings that empower users to conduct more comprehensive data analyses. To access these settings, simply click on the designated icon located on the charts, as depicted in the image below. Upon clicking, the chart settings panel will seamlessly appear on the right-hand side of the grid, offering users a convenient and intuitive way to fine-tune their analytical experience.\nChart settings panel will appear as shown below.\nOn the settings panel, X-axis and Y-axis fields appear which show which attribute is drawn on X-axis and which Metric fields are drawn on Y-axis. Remember that X-axis will have only one attribute whereas Y-axis can have up to 2 metric fields as there can be Y1 and Y2-axis.\nIf the attribute that is there on the X-axis is clicked, the data on the X-axis will get sorted in ascending order. If it is clicked for the second time, data will get sorted in descending order as shown below.\nClick on the X-axis field.\nData will be sorted in ascending order on the x-axis and on the drawn chart as shown below:\nIf that attribute field is clicked again, data be sorted in descending order on the x-axis and on chart:\nNow talking about the\nY-Axis field\non chart settings. There will be 2 metric fields for Y-Axis. One will be on the Y1 axis and the other one will be on the Y2 axis. So on the\nY-Axis field\non chart settings, if both the checkboxes are checked then both the fields will be drawn on the Y2 axis. And if both the checkboxes are unchecked, then both the fields will be drawn on the Y1 axis. If only one of the metric field's checkboxes is checked then that field will be drawn on Y2 whereas the one whose checkbox is not checked will be drawn on the Y1 axis.\nHuman-readable format\nA toggle labeled \"Human-readable format\" is present. When enabled, it indicating that significant values within both the grid and chart will be presented in a user-friendly manner. This entails rendering values such as 10,000,000 as 10M and 24,000 as 24K for enhanced readability. Should users wish to revert to unformatted values for precise examination, they can conveniently deactivate this feature by toggling it off.\nAttributes & Dates section\nThis section will have all the attributes and dates that can be drawn on X-axis. It will contain the string, date, and number type attributes. Users can click on any of the attributes and select it. Since there can only be one attribute on X-axis so if any of the attribute is selected from this section, then it will be drawn on the chart's X-axis.\nMetric Fields section\nThis section will be disabled in case 2 metrics are already selected. In order to select some metric from this section, a maximum of one metric field should be pre-selected. Once it is enabled then user can select any of the metrics and it will be drawn on Y1-axis.\nIf 2 metric fields are selected then all the fields will be disabled as shown below:\nSo in order to select some metric field, first remove one or both fields from the Y-axis section:\nThen it will get enabled and the user will be able to select any of it:\nOnce changes are made in the chart from settings and the user seeks to revert the chart to its original default configuration, the \"Reset to default\" button can be employed. By clicking this button, the chart will be reset to its initial state, restoring the original settings.",

Manage Access\nIntroduction\nConversational AI for Data-Driven Insights (CADDI)\nmakes it effortless to interact with your data, understand it, and extract reliable insights\nby using plain English. This article explains how to configure a CADDI Agent.\nDetailed Steps\n1. Creating a Agent\nAgents can be found on the Sources Detail page. Any Source that will have Chat Enabled will have the Agent Tab. Chat Access can be given to any source through the Module Settings. For more information, click on\nUser Role and Module Settings\n.\nAgent Tab can be found on the detail page of the source for which Chat is enabled.\n`\nThe \"Agents\" tab can be seen next to the \"Settings\" Tab. On clicking on Agents, a new Agent can be created:\nWhen a new Agent is created, the user is landed on the Definition Tab of the Ageny. In a Data source, there can be several Tables. Users can either use all the tables in the agent or user can limit the agent to some specific sources by adding tables from the Available Tables.\nAny added table shows up in \"Tables For Chat\". Users can also preview the Table to see the data inside it:\nUser can also see individual columns and their profiling by clicking on the \"Manage Fields\" option. Here Users can select or unselect columns of any Table:\nAfter Adding the necessary Tables, the user can click on the \"Done\" and \"Save\" button to save the changes:\n2. Train Agent\nAfter the user has selected specific tables and saved the changes, along with the \"Definition\" Tab, the \"Train Agent\" tab can be seen. On clicking the \"Train Agent,\" user can see the \"Generate Questions\" button up front and the Chat bar below that where questions can be typed:\nOn clicking Generate Questions, some sample questions show up. Users can use these questions for analysis:\nOn the Agent, two types of questions can be asked which are:\n1- Typed Question\n2- Detailed Question\n3. Detailed Question\nA detailed question is one for which:\nSQL Code and Logs are generated\nVisualized Grid, Charts, and Pivot Information are generated\nContext can be set up and Profiling Information is provided\nPositive or Negative feedback can be given for further improvement (Training)\nLogs Generation & SQL Query\nThe Logs, in simpler words, are the information related to when a question is asked and what goes to the Backend in textual form. By default, the logs are not turned on. To turn the logs on, the user will have to enable them from the Chat Preferences:\nOnce the logs are turned on any question is asked the Logs will be printed, and SQL query generated for that question will be printed below the Logs:\nThe Log details and the SQL code can be hidden from the Hide Code/Log icon located below the answer output:\nDifferent Generated Views\nCADDI generates three different views:\nChart View (learn more in\nChart Settings in CADDI\n)\nGrid View\nPivot View (learn more in\nPivot Tables in CADDI\n)\nThe Grid View shows the data in tabular form of the columns that are fetched from the SQL query:\nAlong with the 3 different views there will be a gear icon of Settings which is present when this is clicked settings tab opens up with further three options:\nGeneral\nChart (Learn more in\nChart Settings in CADDI\n)\nField (Explained in Profiling & Filtering below)\nThe General tab contains the toggle button of \"Human readable format\". By default, this option is turned off:\nWhen this option is turned on then it helps in better reading of the data. For example, if there are large values like in thousands or millions then it will show in much more readable format:\nProfiling & Filtering\nProfiling shows the distribution of different values of a column which helps in a better understanding of the data. Users can apply filters on the Grid through profiling by selecting particular values. The profiling of any column is opened by clicking the column heading in the grid. When the profiling of any column is opened then the \"Settings ---> Field\" tab is opened up.\nWhen no column is selected and from \"Show settings\", the \"Field\" option is selected then no profiling of the column will be shown. Instead, it will show this:\nDate type column\nFor any date type column user can set different date formats according to the requirement.\nOnce any date format is selected then in the grid that particular date format will be applied:\nNote: When any date format is selected then it applies to every question that was previously asked or will be asked\nThe Grid can be filtered from the visual distribution section. A handle is provided which helps in applying filters according to different values. Once the values are selected then the grid on the left will be filtered accordingly:\nDecimal type column\nThe Profiling of any column that has the data type can be opened by just clicking on the column heading in the grid. The difference is that there are some additional changes provided in its profiling. Users have the option to set decimal values after the point according to the requirement:\nFilters can be applied from the visual distribution section. For this particular example, the handle is not present below the distribution bars because if the distinct values for the columns are less than 20 then there will be no handle provided, users can click on the bars to fill in \"Minimum\" and \"Maximum\" values.\nInteger type column\nThe Profiling can be opened by clicking on the column heading. For the columns having data type there are no additional options, there will be just visual distribution present from where \"Minimum\" and \"Maximum\" values can be selected:\nHere in the above example, the handle is provided below the distribution bars because, for this particular column, the distinct count exceeds 20. The logic that handle should be present or not is the same for columns having data type \"Decimal\" and \"Integer\".\nString type column\nThe Profiling can be opened similarly by just clicking on the column heading present in the grid. The visual distribution for the string-type columns is a little different from other data types. Filters can be applied by selecting different bars and on the grid the filters will be applied accordingly:\nSaving the Question as Context\nThe question that is asked that can be added as context or\nany specific filter applied on the grid can also be added from the Context icon on the top right of the question:\nThe added context can be seen on the top left of the chat bar below. Users can add more than one context from different datasets. If the context is no longer needed, then it can be removed from Clear Context.\nNext Time when any question related to the dataset is added as context this context will be incorporated into the questions also:\nGiving Feedback\nOften times there will be some questions that may not get answered, or the answer was not according to the user expectations. To tackle this problem, the concept of giving Feedback is introduced. The feedback can be positive if the user is satisfied with the answer:\nBut there will be times when the user will not be satisfied with the answer or the query generated for that question is wrong, due to which the question may give an error. In this case, the user can give negative feedback:\nIn the negative feedback, the user can select an option like whether the Didn't get the right data. Didn't visualize properly or Other. In addition, the user can explain in plain English about how the question should be approached, or the user can write the correct SQL query that should have been generated:\nWhen the feedback is submitted, this feedback is taken into consideration when the next question will be asked. This is the kind of training that we are doing, so the accuracy of results can be improved over time.\nGenerating Answers Based on Different Tools\nOften times users will require some questions to be answered in a visualized form and there would be scenarios where users would want just typed answers. For this purpose before asking a question user can select the tool that will generate the answer based on the selected tool. The three tools are located at the top right of the chat bar:\nThere are 3 different types of Tools that can be selected before writing up any question:\nSQL Query Tool\nData Understanding Tool\nGeneral Knowledge Tool\nSQL Query Tool\nBy default when any agent is opened the selected tool is the \"SQL Query tool\":\nWhen the tool chosen is \"SQL Query Tool\" then when the user asks a question from any dataset then for that answer, SQL code and answer in visualized form (Charts and Grid) will be given. The questions asked by using the \"SQL Query Tool\" are detailed type questions that were explained in the article above.\nFor Technical users, they can verify which tool is being used. If the selected tool is \"SQL Query Tool\" then on the Log details it can be seen:\nData Understanding Tool\nThe Data Understanding Tool can be used where the user wants some information about some columns present in the dataset e.g. range of values or different distributions of column. In this tool SQL Code and Visualized Grid will only be generated if necessary otherwise the answer is usually given in typed form where visualization is not required:\nGeneral Knowledge Tool\nThis tool can be used if the user wants to ask questions that are not related to the datasets present in the Data Catalog application. Any general knowledge questions can be asked by using this tool. One use case of this tool can be for example there are some definitions for some columns for a particular dataset but user wants to know the industrial definition then this tool can be handy. This tool is located next to the Data Understanding tool:\n4. Add a Concept\nIn the CADDI agent detail page, users can refine and enhance the agent's performance through the Training tab. This feature allows users to add and manage concepts that impact the agent's responses, as well as handle feedback to ensure continuous improvement. In the CADDI agent detail page, there is a Training tab where users can train the agent. From the Training tab, users can add different concepts that impact the results of CADDI. For a step-by-step guide on how to train your CADDI agent effectively go to the following article\nTraining a CADDI Agent\n.\n5. Basic CRUD Operations\nOn the top right of the Agent, some basic operations can be pretty handy for the users. There are two filters which are:\nAsked By\nStatus\nThe \"Asked By\" gives the option of filtering the questions that are asked by different users in the agent. All the different users who have asked the questions in the agent can be seen in this filter:\nThere is another filter \"Status\" that will filter the questions according to different question types. The following are the filter values:\nAll\nTo Review\nFailed to Generate\nApproved\nRejected\nConcepts\nWith the two filters, there are three dots, users have the option of \"Refresh All\", which refreshes all the questions and Expand/Collapse All, which will expand or collapse all the questions present in the agent.\nThe user has the option of Duplicating & Deleting the Agent. If the user wants to work on the same agent, but the user does not want to affect the original agent so the agent can be duplicated. If the user wants to delete the agent, then the option is available along with the duplicate button.\nSome more basic information about the Source and Agent can be found below the Agent name, like questions asked, tables, and Chat exclusion criteria, which are mentioned in the Module Settings for this source. The link to the Module settings article can be found\nhere\n6. Manage Access\nBy default, when any Agent is created, then it is private, and it is indicated by a \"lock\" icon present in front of the name of the agent . Users have the option of sharing the Agent with other users or user groups through Manage Access:\nOn clicking Manage Access, a modal opens up where the user can enter any user group or users with whom he wants to share the Agent. 2 types of Access can be given which are:\nChat Only\nEdit\n\"Chat Only\" access means that the user will only have access to CAADI chat (Talk to your Data). In \"Chat Only\", the user will not have any access to the agent, which is present on the Sources Detail page. Once the user shares the agent and gives \"Chat Only\" Access, another user will receive an email, and a link will be provided.\nThe Link provided in the email takes the user to CAADI chat (Talk to your Data). For more information about CAADI chat (Talk to your Data), go through the article\nhere\nWhen the agent is shared with Access as \"Edit,\" then the other user will have edit access to the Agent that is present on the source detail page. When the agent is shared with other users with access as \"Edit\", then the user will receive an email with a link.\nThe email link takes the user to the \"Definition\" Tab of the Agent. This user can also make changes in the original agent since he has edit access:\nOnce the user has given \"Chat Only\" access or \"Edit\" access, then on Manage access, there is another option of \"Remove Access\", which basically will remove the Chat and Edit access to the other user:\nAll the editors of the agent can change permissions for other users except for the creator of the agent.\nFor here the above user is an Editor of the agent, this user can add new users and remove access from already existing users but the permissions of the agent creator can never be changed",

    "content": "In this Article:\nData Analysis and Artificial Intelligence\nHow Chat History Works with CADDI\nMulti-Language Support in CADDI\nData Analysis and Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role in data analysis by providing a simple interface to extract insights from large and complex data sets. With its ability to process natural language quickly, AI helps people make better-informed decisions, identify patterns and trends, and uncover hidden insights that might otherwise go unnoticed. In DvSum users have the ability to talk to their data using\nC\nonversational\nA\nI for\nD\nata-\nD\nriven\nI\nnsights (CADDI). DvSum CADDI makes it effortless to interact with your data, understand it, and extract reliable insights.\nNote:\nFor more details on CADDI chat refre \"\nCADDI Chat (Talk to your Data)\n\" article.\nHow to talk to the data in DvSum Data Intelligence\nBefore we start chatting with data, first we need to create a topic and share it with some users. Here I have a chat topic shown below which I have shared with the user. Go to the chat topic detail page and follow the steps below to see how we can share the topic with some other users.\nAfter sharing the chat topic, click on \"Talk to Your Data\" from the left navigation. This will open the Conversational page in a new tab.\nIn the Conversational tab, all the analyses shared with users will appear as topics. Select the desired topic to begin the conversation.\nOnce the topic is selected, an About section of that chat will appear on the new chat which will contain details of the topic i.e. that chat topic is created for which dataset, who are the owners of that dataset, etc.\nClick on the \"Sample Data\" button and it will show the sample data of that data set.\nFrom the sample data user can have some basic insights of what data is about and how it looks like. Users can select different columns and apply filters to check the results.\nOnce sample data is explored generically, now users can move forward by asking different questions to have more to-the-point insights into the data. In the current example I have selected the Order History table so I will try asking questions to explore data further as shown below.\nHere is the result:\nThe result shown above shows a line chart of the insights for which the question was asked. It shows the insights in graphical form of all the orders that were placed recently in the current month. In order to see the results in the form of a grid then click on the \"Toggle View\" button as shown below and it will also show a grid view of the results.\nThe type of chart depends on what query is generated from the question and what results are fetched. If datetime column and metric count in results is greater than or equal to 1 then the line chart will show up as shown in the case above. Whereas if datetime column count is 0 and the attribute and the metric count are greater than or equal to 1 then the Bar chart will show up as shown in the example below.\nWhereas if results just show one row and column then the Tile chart will show up as shown below.\nUsers can also change the topic within the chat. Click on the topics button and it will show up all the topics. Select any and it will show its About section.\nHow Chat History Works with CADDI\nCADDI supports chat history as well, allowing the system to use context from previous questions to provide more accurate and relevant responses to follow-up questions. The system first determines whether a question is a follow-up or a standalone query. If it is identified as a follow-up, it utilizes previous context to provide a more accurate and relevant response, similar to how other advanced agents, such as ChatGPT, operate. The example below illustrates how the system maintains the context of previously asked questions.\nFirstly, the following question was asked: '\nHow many members are from the state of California?\n', and it showed the results.\nAfter that, a follow-up question was asked: '\nShow me how many of them have diabetes and are in their 30s\n.'\nThe second follow-up question didn’t include any specific information about members from California, yet it still identified members from that state. This is because the system used the context from the first question, which mentioned California\nMulti-Language Support in CADDI\nCADDI also supports multiple languages, allowing users to query and receive insights in their preferred language. This feature enhances the platform’s accessibility and usability for a diverse global audience.\nLanguages supported by CADDI include, but are not limited to, German, Spanish, Chinese, French, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, Italian, and Korean, among others.\nFor example, if the query is submitted in Spanish, both the response and explanation are provided in the same language.",

Similarly, there is a limited number of exceptions that are displayed in the cleansing workbench.\nWhere do these limits come from?\nEvery table of a source has its own staging configuration from where the administrator can control the number of records to be processed at a time and the number of exceptions which can be displayed at a time. This means if there are 1,241 exceptions (refer to the image above), you will only see 300 of the exceptions. Once these 300 are fixed and the rule is executed again, it will show 941 (1241 - 300) exceptions.\nCan I show higher number of exceptions in extract?\nAllowed Review limit: 300 - 10,000*\n1. When the rule is run in\nonline mode\n(through online execution), it will give the correct exception count in Run Result, but the actual detail is 300 records in cleansing workbench.\n2. When the rule is run in\nbatch mode\n(through scheduler), it will still have the same count, and the actual detail extract is up to 10,000 records in cleansing workbench.\n*Note: These are the 2 boundary limits. Changing that number below 300 will not decrease and changing from 10,000 to a higher number will not increase the limit.\nAll exceptions in Online Run\nThis small button has the power to show you all exceptions on Analysis tab of rule detail page.

    "content": "Overview\nThis document is a guide on how to use Dvsum Address Validation API. Dvsum Address Validation API helps the users to validate their address data thus getting a clean and more meaningful and understandable address.\nIn this document, we will learn the following things:\nDvsum Address Validation API endpoint: The REST endpoint to access the amazing Address Validation functionality\nThe HTTP method to ping this endpoint.\nRequest Format: The format in which the data is to be sent to the API.\nResponse Format: The format in which the API will return the validated results.\nError Codes: If some error occurs, error codes help to know what kind of error it is.\nURL\nhttps://apis.dvsum.com/address-validation\nMethod\nThe request type is\nPOST\n.\nAuthentication Header\nRequest header should contain the following header.\nx-api-key: <api-key-value>\nRequest Payload\nThe address data needs to be sent to API in the request body of the POST request. Following is the structure of how the request body is to be created.\n{\n\"addresses\": [\n{\n\"address_line1\": \"\",\n\"city\": \"\",\n\"zip_code\": \"\",\n\"country\": \"\",\n\"company_name\": \"\",\n\"address_line2\": \"\",\n\"address_line3\": \"\",\n\"state\": \"\",\n\"other_address_lines\": \"\"\n}\n],\n\"case_format\": \"\",\n\"zip_code_format\": \"\"\n}\nNow, let us dig deep into each of these fields.\n“addresses”\n(mandatory)\ncontains the address data that is to be validated. It can contain the following fields.\n“address_line1”\nmainly contains the data of the street i.e., street number and street name. However, it can also contain the data that one is supposed to enter in “address_line2” and “address_line3”.\n“city”\ncontains name of the city.\n“zip_code”\ncontains zip code. It can be added either in US format or non-US format.\n“country”\npreferably contains abbreviated name of the country; however, full name can also be provided but in that case matched status will be\nFor example,\nif user wants to enter United States, he/she should enter\nUS\nrather than the full name.\n“address_line2” (optional)\ncontains the data of Suite/Apartment/Building.\n“address_line3” (optional)\ncontains c/o information and attention.\n“state” (optional)\npreferably contains abbreviated name of the state or province, however, full name can also be provided but in that case matched status will be\nFor example, if user wants to enter New York, he/she should enter\nNY\nrather than the full name.\n“case_format” (optional)\nrepresents the case format in which the results are to be returned. It can have any of these three values,\n“UPR”\n: Converts the results in upper case.\n“LWR”\n: Converts the results in lower case.\ncase_format is an\noptional\nfield. Hence, if not provided, its default value will apply which will return results in\nInitCap\nformat. For example, the street address “4000 KRESGE WAY REC DOCK” will be converted to “4000 Kresge Way Rec Dock”. Here, you can see that the first letter of each word is in uppercase and the rest are in lowercase.\nFor\nOK\nresult API is doing case sensitive check which means input address is exactly same as matched one then it is considering as ok. Any case change or standardization (Road to Rd) consider as Standardize.\n“zip_code_format” (optional)\nrepresents the Zip code format in which the results are to be returned.\nFor US, zip code format can have any of these two values,\n“FULL”\n: Returns complete zip code which contains 5 initial letters and 4 additional letters in the following format “xxxxx-xxxx”.\n“INIT”\n: Returns only the initial 5 letters of the zip code.\nFor non-US, zip code format might not be provided. API will validate it and might add a whitespace. For example, L5T2N7 will get converted to L5T 2N7. In this case, matched status will be standardized.\nzip_code_format is an optional field. Hence, if not provided “\nFULL\n” will be used as its value.\nNote:\nAll the field names are to be provided in lower case.\nOut of these fields, it is mandatory to provide “address_line1”, “country” and either “city” or “zip_code”.\nResponse Format\nThe validated address is returned by the API in the form of JSON. Its format is as follows.\n{\n\"results\": [\n{\n\"matched_address_line1\": \"\",\n\"matched_address_line2\": \"\",\n\"extra_information\": \"\",\n\"matched_city\": \"\",\n\"matched_state\": \"\",\n\"matched_zip_code\": \"\",\n\"matched_country\": \"\",\n\"matched_complete_address\": \"\",\n\"matched_location_type\": \"\",\n\"matched_status\": \"\",\n\"matched_status_name\": \"\",\n\"longitude_coordinates\": \"\",\n\"latitude_coordinates\": \"\",\n\"street_number\": \"\",\n\"street_name\": \"\",\n\"zip_code\": \"\",\n\"zip_code_suffix\": \"\",\n\"input_complete_address\": \"\",\n\"partial_match\": \"\",\n\"matched_address_types\": []\n}\n]\n}\nLet us, dig into each of these fields.\n“results”\nwill have a list of matched addresses. Address contains the following fields\n“matched_address_line1”\ncontains the validated data of the street i.e., street number and street name\n“matched_address_line2”\ncontains the validated data of Suite/Apartment/Building.\n“extra_information”\ncontains extra address data, which is usually not part of standard address data, if input address contains any c/o information (phone number, person name etc.).\n“matched_city”\ncontains validated name of the city.\n“matched_state”\ncontains abbreviated name of the validated state or province.\nHere, it will still contain abbreviated name even if full name of state or province was provided in the input address. And hence, match status in this case will be Standardized.\n“matched_zip_code”\ncontains the validated zip code.\nFor\nUS\nIf\n“FULL”\nwas provided as zip code format in the input address, full zip code will be provided in the following format 40207-4605.\nIf\n“INIT”\nwas provided as zip code format in the input address, only initial 5 letters of zip code will be provided. (only 40207 in this case)\nFor\nnon-US\na zip code will either be provided as it is.\nor with an added whitespace will be provided. For example, L5T2N7 will get converted to L5T 2N7. In this case, matched status will be standardized.\n“matched_country”\ncontains abbreviated name of the validated country.\nHere, it will still contain abbreviated name even if full name of the country was provided in the input address. And hence, match status in this case will be Standardized.\n“matched_complete_address”\ncontains the complete validated address. It is basically comma separated concatenation of all the above explained matched fields. There is no comma in between\n“matched_address_line1”, “matched_address_line2”\nand\n“matched_state”, “matched_zip_code”\n“matched_location_type”\nstores additional data about the specified location. The following values are currently supported:\n\"ROOFTOP\"\nindicates that the returned result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.\n\"RANGE_INTERPOLATED\"\nindicates that the returned result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.\n\"GEOMETRIC_CENTER\"\nindicates that the returned result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (region).\n\"APPROXIMATE\"\nindicates that the returned result is approximate.\n“matched_status_name”\ncontains the complete name of the matched status. It can contain one of these values:\nIncomplete\nOK\nStandardized\nEnrich\nNo match\nEach of these statuses is explained next.\n“matched_status”\ncontains the status of the matched address in abbreviated format. it may contain the following values based on intelligence:\nINC, OK, SD, ER, NM\nINC (Incomplete)\ni\nndicates that the provided address data is not complete and is returned if any of the below conditions is fulfilled:\naddress_line1 is empty.\ncountry is empty.\ncity and zip_code both are empty.\nOK\ni\ns returned if following conditions are fulfilled:\nmatched_location_type is “\nROOFTOP\n”.\nmatched_address_line1 exists.\nmatched_city exists.\nmatched_zip_code exists.\nmatched_country exists.\nInput address and validated address are exactly same without any case difference or if\n\"\ncase_format\"\nis\n\"DEF\"\nthen input address and validated address will be compared as case insensitive.\nSD (Standardized)\ni\ns returned if following conditions are fulfilled:\nmatched_location_type is \"\nROOFTOP\"\n.\nmatched_address_line1 exists.\nmatched_city exists.\nmatched_zip_code exists.\nmatched_country exists.\nThere is only\nZIP Code\ndeference between provided address and validated address (example: 63122-6604, 63122 or 63122, 63122-6604). If\n\"\nzip_code_format\"\nvalue is\n\"INIT\"\nthen it will compare the first 5 characters only.\nThere is\nabbreviated form\nfound in the validated address (example: Henry Street, Henry St).\nER (Enrich)\ni\ns returned if following conditions are fulfilled:\nmatched_location_type is “\nROOFTOP\n”.\nmatched_address_line1 exists.\nmatched_city or matched_zip_code exists.\nmatched_country exists.\nValidated address is a bit changed from provided address (example: Henry Road, Henry St).\nThere is only\nZIP Code\ndeference between provided address, validated address (example: 63121, 63122).\nNM (No match)\nis returned if none of the above status is returned.\n“longitude_coordinates”\ncontains the longitude coordinate of the provided location.\n“latitude_coordinate”\ncontains the latitude coordinate of the provided location.\n“street_name”\ncontains the name of the validate street.\n“street_number”\ncontains the number of the validated street.\n“zip_code”\ncontains the initial 5 letters of the validated zip code. For example, if 40207-4605 was provided as a zip code, then\n“zip_code”,\nwill contain only 40207.\n“zip_code_suffix”\ncontains the last 4 letters of the validated zip code. For example, if 40207-4605 was provided as a zip code, then\n“zip_code_suffix”,\nwill contain only 4605.\n“input_complete_address”\ncontains complete address that was provided to the API. It is basically comma separated concatenation of all the input fields There is no comma in between\n\"address_line1”, \"address_line2\", \"address_line3\", \"other_address_lines\"\nand\n\"state”, \"zip_code\"\n“matched_address_types”\narray indicates the type of the returned result. This array contains a set of zero or more tags identifying the type of feature returned in the result. For example, a geocode of \"Chicago\" returns \"locality\" which indicates that \"Chicago\" is a city.\nThe following types are supported and returned in the matched_address_type  arrays:\nstreet_address\nindicates a precise street address.\nroute\nindicates a named route (such as \"US 101\").\nintersection\nindicates a major intersection, usually of two major roads.\npolitical\nindicates a political entity. Usually, this type indicates a polygon of some civil administration.\ncountry\nindicates the national political entity and is typically the highest order type.\nadministrative_area_level_1\nindicates a first-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are states. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels. In most cases, administrative_area_level_1 short name will closely match ISO 3166-2 subdivisions and other widely circulated lists; however, this is not guaranteed as our geocoding results are based on a variety of signals and location data.\nadministrative_area_level_2\nindicates a second-order civil entity below the country level. Within the United States, these administrative levels are counties. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\nadministrative_area_level_3\nindicates a third-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\nadministrative_area_level_4\nindicates a fourth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\nadministrative_area_level_5\nindicates a fifth-order civil entity below the country level. This type indicates a minor civil division. Not all nations exhibit these administrative levels.\ncolloquial_area\nindicates a commonly used alternative name for the entity.\nlocality\nindicates an incorporated city or town political entity.\nsublocality\nindicates a first-order civil entity below a locality. For some locations may receive one of the additional types: sublocality_level_1 to sublocality_level_5. Each sublocality level is a civil entity. Larger numbers indicate a smaller geographic area.\nneighborhood\nindicates a named neighborhood\npremise\nindicates a named location, usually a building or collection of buildings with a common name\nsubpremise\nindicates a first-order entity below a named location, usually a singular building within a collection of buildings with a common name\npostal_code\nindicates a postal code as used to address postal mail within the country.\nnatural_feature\nindicates a prominent natural feature.\nairport\nindicates an airport.\npark\nindicates a named park.\npoint_of_interest\nindicates a named point of interest. Typically, these \"POI\"s are prominent local entities that do not easily fit in another category, such as \"Empire State Building\" or \"Eiffel Tower\".\nIn addition to the above, address components may include the types below.\nfloor\nindicates the floor of a building address.\nestablishment\ntypically indicates a place that has not yet been categorized.\nlandmark\nindicates a nearby place that is used as a reference, to aid navigation.\npoint_of_interest\nindicates a named point of interest.\nparking indicates\na parking lot or parking structure.\npost_box\nindicates a specific postal box.\npostal_town\nindicates a grouping of geographic areas, such as locality and sublocality, used for mailing addresses in some countries.\nroom indicates\nthe room of a building address.\nstreet_number\nindicates the precise street number.\nbus_station, train_station and transit_station indicate the location of a bus, train or public transit stop.\nAn empty list of types indicates there are no known types for a particular address component, for example, Lieu-dit in France.\n“partial_match”\nindicates that the geocoder did not return an exact match for the original request, though it was able to match part of the requested address.

With Email Optimization, we will be giving the control on user profile page (click user name at top right corner + click Profile option in the drop-down to navigate to User Profile) to set the frequency of the Notification Alert type.\nYou will be provided with the notification settings on the profile page through which respective flags can be controlled.\nNotifications settings are segregated into following parts\nNotification Frequency\nNotification Type\nNotification Frequency\nInstant:\nNotifications will be received as they were previously. Emails will be received right away as the event gets completed.\nHourly:\nNotifications will be received on the hourly basis i.e all the set of actions performed in previous hour will be consolidated in a single email and then sent to the respective user. No emails will be received instantly then.\nDaily:\nNotifications will be received on the daily basis i.e all the set of actions performed in previous day will be consolidated in a single email and then sent to the respective user. No emails will be received instantly or hourly then.\nNever:\nNotifications will never be received on setting Never as frequency from the list.\nNotification Type\nThere are five standard notification types in DvSum application.

So if it is disabled and you schedule a job with yourself added as recipient in that job, you will not be receiving the job completion email.\nEnable to receive schedule email if you create the job.\nNote: If you are the job creator and you have turned off the notification and added external user in that job, the external user will not be receiving the job completion email. The resolution is that you must have to select at-least one internal user in that job.",

    "title": "Manage Roles",
    "url": "https://dvsum.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052075952-Manage-Roles",
    "content": "There are different set of users who use DvSum application. If Admin wants to provide access to particular set of users/groups or if he wants to restrict the access of certain modules, here's how to do it.\nManage Users\nStep 1:\nIn this section, there is a field \"Module Access Role\". In this column, the default roles will be displayed as same as Roles for existing users. For instance; if an existing user has an 'Admin' role then it will also appear as 'Admin' in Module access role column as shown below:\nStep 2:\nIf you create a new user and wants to give it a different level of access, then, first select the user, click the 'Edit user' button. It will open up an Edit user interface where you can see the new field added as 'Manage Access Role'. It will have all the existing default roles, also the new roles that are added from which you can select. For instance; you select 'Analyst' role for user 'Admin' and hit Save.\nNote:\nNow it will have restricted access that is given at Analyst level. Please note that even though the user role is set as 'Admin' but the preference of access will be granted according to option set in 'Module Access Role'.\nManage Roles\nStep 3: Default Roles and access\nPlease note that for existing users, their default roles i.e Owner, Admin, user, super user level will have no change. Also, the default roles (Owner, Admin, user, super user) cannot be edited or deleted from here and there will be no 'Created by' and 'Modified By' data in the cell. These roles will be generated by default here.\nBy default Owner will have access to all tabs. Admin will have access to Admin tab, Reference dictionary and Batch execution. Super user will have access to reference dictionary and Batch execution. Normal user will have no default access at all.\nBut for custom role(s) (custom role that is created by user), these permissions can be changed as explained in step 7\nOwner\nAdmin\nSuper User\nUser\nAdministration tab\n✓\n✓\n✕\n✕\nManage Account Tab\n✓\n✕\n✕\n✕\nDelete a user from Admin Tab\n✓\n✕\n✕\n✕\nReference Dictionary\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✕\nBatch Execution\n✓\n✓\n✓\n✕\nStep 4: View Users\nIf you want to view list of users that have a role set as as 'Admin' and their user 'Status' then click this 'View users' button and it will display a new interface consisting list of all users added as an Admin as shown below:\nStep 5: Create Role\nAdditionally, we have provided user a facility to create more roles other than just default roles which later can be assigned to users with different level of role access. These custom roles can be edited or deleted based on the access given which later is explained in\nStep 8\nthat shows how it can be set.\nIn the Create Role interface, there is 'Name', 'Clone from role' and 'description' field. The clone from role will enable you to select role from any existing roles and the permission for this new role will be set accordingly which later can be modified.\nStep 6 : Role Detail Page\nAs soon as the role is created user will land on the Role detail page. User can navigate back to Manage Roles page by clicking it from top. Also, if you want to view list of users, then click 'View Users' link. Under this, all the modules and sub modules of DvSum application are displayed and from here, you can control permissions for these as shown below:\nNote:\nPlease note that the access of Dashboard will always be enabled and cannot be changed. For instance; if some user has no access of any module or sub module in DvSum application then dashboard by default will always be visible.\nStep 7 : Setting up Permission(s)\nLet's say the role 'Access Module' that is just created, you turn off the switch for 'Manage Dashboard' and 'Advanced Analytics' for it. Click the Save button.\nStep 7.1\nNow any user that this role is assigned to will not have access to these two sub modules of Dashboard. Let's say, you select any user from Manage users section and assign this Role to it as shown below:\nNote:\nFrom here you can also verify that, the user role is set as 'Admin' but the permission of access will be preferred based on what role is set in 'Module Access Role'.\nStep 7.2\nTo verify it, login from that user account and check the options right under Dashboard section. Those two sub modules will not be showing down there as shown below:\nStep 7.3\nIf you switch off the main Module permission then that particular module will not be visible on main DvSum application menu. For instance; Administration tab is switched off for above user then on login from that account, it will be hidden as shown below:\nStep 8  Manage Role: Viewing/Creating/Editing/Deleting Role\nFurthermore, in this version v1.0 of manage access, we have enabled you to further set permissions of Viewing, Creating, Editing, and Deleting in 'Manage Role' under the Administration module. If you want to enable this role to be able to only view/create/edit/delete or do all of these, it can be done from here.\nFor instance; set the view permission in the Manage role for 'Access Module' and Save the changes as shown below\nStep 8.1\nSpecifically, for Data Dictionary the Read/Write access can be done like this.\nBy selecting the view only access for Table DIctionary, it will allow user to only view all the details from listing view of table / column dictionary respectively. User can not make any changes from listing view pages e.g:\n1.\nRow Level Operations:\nMass Update, Hide/Unhide Rows, Refresh Relationships.\n2.\nColumn Level Operations:\nInline editing for editable columns e.g:\na.\nTable Dictionary:\nTable Type. Table Entity, Data Domain, Subject Area, User Description & Comments.\nb.\nColumn Dictionary:\nColumnn Type, Entity Type, DQ Category, Sensitivity Level, CDE, User Description & Glossary Term.\n3. Table Detail Page:\nPublish/Unpublish, Overview section (User description), Stewards, Primary Attributes, Relationships & comments.\nStep 8.2\nLogin from that user account OR if you have already logged in, just refresh the page. Select that role and you will see that above options do not get enabled. You will be able to only View it but cannot make any modification. That is the reason because we have restricted the access to modify it. Just like that you can set any other permission from Manage role i.e View, Edit/create/Delete.\nNote:\nThis is for customer roles only not for the default roles (Admin, user, super user)\nStep 9  Deleting Role\nIn case of Deleting a role, when you click Delete button then it will require you to transfer the control to any other role if that role has user(s) associated with it.\nNote:\nOnce you transfer the role to a different role, keep in mind that permissions will also get updated based on new role assigned here.\nStep 9.1\nIf any role does not have any user(s) associated here, then it will further ask you to confirm and then Delete the role as shown below:\nStep 10 Access denied Message when accessing with in application from a page\nTo understand this, lets simply take an example. If you switch off 'Table dictionary' permission for this user.  Save the changes. Login from that account, click profiling and then click any table name.\nStep 10.1\nSince this user has no access to table dictionary, on clicking any table name, it will notify you that Permission is denied for accessing table detail page. If you click OK you will be redirected to Dashboard and if you 'Click here' then you will be redirected to main Profiling page.\nStep 10.2 Access denied Message when accessing using URL\nFor example; you are not allowed to access Profiling module, if you copy and paste the URL \"prod.dvsum.com/profiling\" in new tab and hit enter then it will notify you that Access is denied\nStep 10.3\nIf you click OK then it will redirect you to main Dashboard page as shown below:\nStep 11: Other Associated Modules Permission and Permission Denied Messages\nHere is the list of some other associated modules that will be operational same as above example.\nManage / Analyze Rules\nDashboard (Rule list widget)\nProfiling (Table -> View Rules)\nProfiling (Table -> Data Quality -> Anayze Rule)\nProfiling (Table -> Data analysis -> Add business rule)\nProfiling (Table -> Data analysis -> View business rule)\nTable / Column Data Dictionary (Table detail -> Data Quality section)\nComply (Action Items Grid -> Rule Id)\nManage workflow (Add / edit task -> Rule Id)\nGlossary (Term Detail -> Data policy -> Rule Id)\nTable Dictionary - Table Detail\nProfiling -> Table\nColumn Dictionary -> Dataset\nElastic Serach Results (Table Name)\nScheduler\nManage Sources\nProfiling\nManage / Analyze Rules\nBatch Execution\nData Prep workbench\nTable / Column Data Dictionary (Table detail - > Data Preparation section)\nWorkflow\nGlossary - Term Detail (Process Workflows -> Workflow Id)\nGlossary - Term\nData Prep Workbench (Assigned asset columns -> Term)\nColumn Dictionary listing (Glossary Column -> Associated Term Name)\nElastic Serach Results (Term Name)",

Users can easily edit table details and manage rules, enabling seamless decision-making and data quality maintenance.\nSample View:\nFinding the Table Detail Page\nData Catalog → Table Dictionary:\nProfile → Profiling → View Catalog:\nFunctionality\nRun Profiling\nData profiling will query the data source to gather metrics about the data. It will also generate suggested DQ rules based on the data and metadata that it discovers.\nProfile Table → Run Online\nThis will promptly initiate the profiling process. A progress bar will display the ongoing progress. It's crucial to stay on the page during profiling, as it operates synchronously. Leaving the page will result in the cancellation of the profiling process.\nProfile Table → Run Offline\nThis will schedule a profiling job to run in the background. The job will typically start within the next minute, and this is the recommended approach for profiling large tables that may require several minutes to complete. You can navigate to other pages without affecting the job, and the updated statistics will be available once the job finishes. Check the job status here:\nReview → Scheduler.\nThe\nProfile Table button will be\nYellow\nif profiling has never run. Afterwards, it will change to\nBlue.\nEdit Table\nEdit the table details by clicking on the\nEdit Table\nbutton.\nThe following fields can be edited:\nDescription\nTable Type\nLoad profile\nAll Data - Select this load profile if data is fully refreshed regularly.\nIncremental Data - Select this if data is normally loaded incrementally (appended).\nIf the load profile is set to incremental, then you should also set the Metric Time field.\nMetric time - Select from the Data and Timestamp fields in the table. This field will be used in relevant DQ rules. For example, when calculating daily load volumes this field will be used to see which records were loaded in the last 24 hours.\nTable Detail Page\nThe Table detail page primarily contains 4 sections as shown in the screenshot below:\nColumns\nDisplays metadata (e.g. data types) and data (e.g. unique count).\nRules - Available Rules\nCreate new rules and review existing rules.\nSelect an existing rule to run it online or offline. For details refer to the article\nRun Online/Offline.\nMore Actions:\nUpdate Schedule -\nupdate the existing schedules or add a new schedule.\nRemove Schedule -\nThis option allows the user to remove any existing schedule of the rule(s)\nDelete rule\n- This option allows the user to Remove the rule permanently\nClone rule\n- This option allows the user to clone the current rule\nMass Update\n- Mass update allows the user to select multiple rules and update them at once\nRules - Recommended rules\nRecommended Rules\nThese are the rules that are recommended based on the profiling of the source's tables\nIf the User wants to add a recommended rule they can simply click on the\nADD\nbutton\nThe following rule types are\nRecommended\n:\nBlank\nValue Range\nCount\nMetric\nSample Data\nThis has info same as Profiling >> Data Analysis. The grid will have all columns that are added in that table and will display sample data for each column.\nRelationship\nIt shows the relationship of the table between different tables, their cardinality/relationship types, Constraint/Key names, database status, recommended status, accepted status, and Zoom in/out. The rejected state will not be shown. If you click any table name from here then it will open up its table detail page separately.\nView Comments\nUsers can view the comments and add a new comment",

    "content": "Overview\nA Blend View combines data from two or more tables of the same source. It's useful in cases the data model is normalized, and a data steward reviewing and correcting errors needs to see fields from multiple related tables. It can also be useful to aggregate data saved at different granularities in different tables.\nBlend Views are available for most data sources, but the exact details will depend on the source technology. If your relational database technology does not support full outer joins, then you may not use a full outer join in your blend view--though DvSum will not prevent you from defining such a view.\nCreate a Blend View\nBegin by selecting Profile → Profiling → \"⊕ Create View\" (visible in the upper-right corner of the page)\nIn the\nCreate View\nwizard, specify the View Type as shown below.\nIn Step 2 of the\nCreate View\nwizard, select 2 or more tables. To create a join between them, click and drag from one table to the other.\nThe Join configuration pop up will provide you the option to select the join type and the columns. DvSum supports join types of inner, outer, left, or right joins, but you should confirm that your relational database technology supports your selected type. DvSum intelligently guesses which columns should be used for the join, but you may add columns or alter the columns used.\nOnce you save the join configurations, the translated join condition will appear.\nAdvanced Option:\nThe FUI interaction provides a simpler user experience in most cases. But an advanced user can provide the Join Query. As soon as you start typing query in the \"Translated Join Condition\" box, DvSum will try to determine the tables for you and automatically reverse engineer the specified join into graph above.\nYou may not see a success message. Sometimes DvSum will not be able to translate the join condition you have provided into a graph. It does not mean there is necessarily a mistake. If you are confident your join condition is correct, then these three steps will suffice to define the joins:\nSelect the Join Tables.\nEnter the Translated Join Condition.\nValidate the join condition.\nIn Step 2 of the\nCreate View\nwizard, the fields of all tables will be displayed on the left. Select the desired fields for your view.\nSave the Blend View.\nThe detail page for this view will open. From here chose \"Run Profiler\" to populate field values.

In a real life scenario, a user uploads a file and create a source in DvSum which uses that file. That file is then profiled and certain rules are made and executed on it. The report generated by these rules provides important stats to make day-to-day business decisions.\nWhen the data in the file changes, a user simply uploads the new file to the folder and runs the same rules again. This saves user the time of repeating the process of profiling and creating rules again.\nNote: This folder should be in the same machine as the SAWS associated with it.\nFollow the steps below to upload file and get started:\nStep 1: Create Folder\nFrom Administration tab, go to Manage Account > Folders and add a folder. You need to specify folder name, folder path and the associated SAWS.\nOnce a folder is added, it will show on the grid and on the\nfile upload page\n.\nStep 2: Upload File\nFile Upload page shows the folders added by all users. If you hover over the folder you created, it will show you the path set for it. Simply add the files in drop-zone and they will be uploaded to the folder. (only excel, csv and txt files are allowed)\nStep 3: Add File as Source\nNow you can create a source using this excel file from Administration > Manage Sources page.\nSpecify the path for where the file is (This could be remote location as well where remote SAWS is running). After saving, \"Configure\" the source and it will open all sheets of excel file.\nNow that the source is added, you can profile it and create DvSum rules on it.\nAdvanced Option:\nIf you want to apply preprocess properties to file in order to cleanse it before creating rules on it, read the article\nExcel Cleansing Upon File Upload\n.",

    "content": "EXCEL Default Cleansing\nWhen a file is uploaded, it is automatically cleansed to make it compatible for DvSum use. DvSum always reads the first row as \"header\" and rest of the rows as \"data\".\nThe default cleansing includes:\nRemoving blank rows\nReplacing white spaces within a column name with underscore e.g. First Column will be changed to First_Column\nSpecial characters from column name are removed\nDuplicate columns are dropped\nHowever in some cases, the default cleansing is not enough and the user needs to explicitly specify if any rows needs to be skipped or specify the format for number columns where the data automatically truncates the values up to required decimal precision, for that purpose, a properties file associated with every uploaded file is available for user to edit.\nEXCEL Pre-process properties\nWhen an excel file is uploaded to folder, properties file is created with the same name as the uploaded file name. A user can manually set the pre-process options to change file formatting. So whenever the same file is uploaded again to the folder, DvSum will automatically apply the pre-process options and cleanse the file accordingly.\nFor example, below is the un-processed file.\n1. There is some extra information in row 1, 3 and 4 which cannot be read by DvSum. User manually needs to inform DvSum to skip these.\n2. Any spaces in between column names will be replaced by underscore and special characters will be removed automatically.\n3. Any blanks rows within the data will be removed automatically.\n4. For number fields, User can inform DvSum to cleanse the values up to a specific decimal precision.\nOnce this file is uploaded to folder, basic cleansing (as mentioned before) will be applied by DvSum and pre-process properties for upload file will be created.\nOpen the pre-process properties file with the name as the original file (AES2test)\nSave the properties file. An important step is to upload the file again to the target folder. This will format the excel source file according to the changes made in preprocess properties.\nNow the file is cleansed and ready to use in DvSum. If you configure this excel source from Manage Sources page, it will show you the cleansed file.\nValidate JSON - Verify syntax of pre-process.properties file\nAs a good practice, we recommend you to validate json of preprocess file to make sure it has no syntax errors. You can validate using\nhttps://jsonlint.com/\nCopy all the content of preprocess.properties file and paste it in text field of jsonlint.com and click on \"Validate JSON\". If there is no syntax error, it will say Valid JSON.\nIf JSON is invalid, it will show you the line where there is an error. Here, you can see there is error on line 11 because there is semi-colon (;) added instead of comma (,)\nIt is recommended to validate json every time you make changes to your pre-process file.",

    "content": "Introducing\nDvSum\nData Preparation Workbench\n, a place where you can access data from source conveniently, prepare and perform cleansing actions and commit validated data back to source. Let's start.\nOn your DvSum homepage, you will see Data Preparation in left navigation. Go to \"Datasets\"\nYou can create multiple datasets on a single table. With every dataset you create, the idea is to filter some part of data for analysis that is according to your requirements. That filtered data will open in a workbench.\nNote: For now, Data Preparation Workbench functionality is only applicable for\nOracle and SQL Server\nsources only\nCreate Dataset\nThere are 3 simple steps to create a dataset.\nStep 1\n- Click on Create button and provide source and table name on which dataset is to be created.\nStep 2\n- Choose Columns and Apply filters (if required)\nHere, you can choose the columns you want to see on workbench and the order by which you want to view them on Workbench. You can also apply filters to dataset according to your requirements.\nStep 3\n- Provide a Unique Identifier, Sync All Dataset User Views (optional), Execute Stored Procedure(optional) and Sharing.\n1. A \"\nUnique identifier\"\nof the table needs to be selected.\n2. \"\nSync All Dataset User Views\n\", will update and sync all the views that you have created on the workbench that are linked.\n3. \"\nExecute Stored Procedure\n\", this will execute stored procedure on commit or on consolidate, write procedure including parameter name.\n3. If you want to \"\nShare\"\nthis dataset with others, select the required option.\nThis is it. You will see the created dataset on the dataset page and when you click on the name, it will open a workbench fetching the data accordingly.\nWorkbench Operations\nThere are multiple operations you can perform on workbench. Here is a list of few:\n1. Inline Editing\nClick on a cell and start editing. The changes will automatically be saved and you can commit the changes to write-back to source.\n2. Drag And Copy\nYou can select a cell and drag cell-selection outline to the place where you want the copy to appear and release the mouse button. Pressing CTRL + D will copy the value to all selected cells.\n3. Find and Replace\nThis is a bulk-update operation performed on a single column. You can even choose to fill all blanks with a particular value across the data source.\nSelect a column and you will see Find and Replace Option.\n4. Delete Rows\nThis is a row level operation. Once you select row(s), you will see the option to Remove Rows. You can remove single or multiple (at max 100) rows at a time. Please note that this will permanently remove the records form your data source and you will not be able to Undo after Committing.\n5. Apply Validations for Write-back\nSometimes there might be certain validations required on a column for write-back operation. For example, Customer_ID should have no blanks, or for a string Column \"Country\" the input value should have only 2 characters (US, UK etc)\nSuch validations can be applied from Profiling page using Master Completeness Ruleset (MDC Ruleset) on a table.\nThere are 3 types of data constraints you can apply from MDC ruleset\n1. Blanks Check\nOn a column where blanks check is applied, workbench will highlight null fields are red and it will not take \"Blank\" as an input\n2. Value Range\nAllow only a specific range of values as valid\n3. Data Format\nConstraints\nValidations on string (character length limit), Number (only integers, whole numbers or decimal values) are to be allowed.\nThese rules are reflected on Workbench. You will see a small badge for each of the rules above (B, VR, DF) below the column name on which rule is applied.\nWhen you hover on the DF badge, it will show you the validation and highlight the cells which do not meet the criteria.\n6. Apply DvSum Rules as Filters\nThe DvSum rules, like Custom Query, Blanks, Value Range, MDC Ruleset, Orphan Records, Integrity Check created on a particular table can help you filter out the data on workbench. You can select one rule at a time on workbench and it will bring only those records which are shown as exception on rule detail page.\nClick on the \"Select a Rule\" drop-down where you will see only the above mentioned rules. If the rule has not been executed, it will show as disabled. Similarly, rules other than the listed will be disabled.\nThe selected rule will start to show on top and it will fetch the records according to rule definition.  This is helpful when you want to perform cleansing actions on selected data.\n7. Reference Column - Data Preparation Workbench\nIf a column has a reference column defined in Field configuration, when we update key column value in Prep workbench, its reference column would also get updated accordingly.\nProfiling - Field Configuration Update -\nWe will now have a Reference Mapping section where user can define Reference column for a Key column\nReference Dictionary Update -\nCurrently, you were able to create reference dictionary by manually adding values from UI (by adding values for the fields) i.e name and description.\nNow, there will be a checkbox 'Is Key Value Pair', if marked this as checked, user will be able to create a Key Value based dictionary.\nOn marking this checkbox checked, you will be able to add key, value and description. Else you can import values\nOn importing values for a column whose reference is not defined in Field Configuration, it will prompt you to select a key column for it and the Reference column will be set in the Field Configuration automatically\nOn importing values for a column whose reference is already defined, it will prompt you. On importing values, it will create a reference dictionary containing distinct values of both columns\nOn saving, it will create a Key Value Based reference dictionary with Is Key Value Pair\nNote:\nWhile creating a MDC rule, on Reference column defined in Field configuration, it will not allow you to create a Value Range rule with normal dictionaries. It will give you a warning message to select a Key Value Pair Dictionary from the list\nData Preparation Workbench Updates-\nOn updating a value of a reference column (if defined in Field Configuration) in the Workbench, it should automatically update the value in its key column accordingly.\nAll those columns having write back enabled will have icon 'Write Back' enabled for them.\nThe defined unique Identifier Column, Key Column will have write back disabled with grayed out column header.\nKey Column will also have a chain icon in the column header. On hover, it will show the related information i.e the reference column defined for it.\nOn updating a value in the Reference Column, it will automatically update the value in the key column accordingly\nThe same operation can also be performed via Find and Replace. Clicking the reference column header checkbox, it will enable the Find and Replace button and values can be updated as required",

Provide the path of the folder where you want to upload excel file.\n2. Upload file to folder\nFrom File upload on left navigation, select the folder you created. Upload the unprocessed excel file in this folder. This is how an unprocessed file will look like.\nOnce uploaded to target folder, DvSum will run pre-processing on the file and apply basic cleansing.\nBasic cleansing includes removing blank rows, replacing white spaces within a column name with underscore e.g. First Column will be changed to First_Column. Special characters from column name are removed. Also, the duplicate columns are dropped. Below is the image how the file looks like after basic cleansing.\nPre-processing file is created against the uploaded excel source in target folder. To do so, go to the target folder and there will be a new folder called \"ExcelPreProcessProps\".\nOpen the folder to access the preprocess.properties file. It a note-pad file with the same name as the excel source file with \"_preProcess\" appended at the end.\n3. Custom Cleansing with Pre-process.properties file\nIn some cases, the default cleansing is not enough. Sometimes a user needs to tell DvSum to skip rows which do not contain actual data. Or specify the format for number columns where the data automatically truncates the values up to required decimal precision. For that purpose, a properties file associated with every uploaded file is available for user to edit.\nAs an example, lets change the data type of one column to \"str\". A particular use case when your data source has numeric field values but you want DvSum to read it as string. For example, in the case below where you want the field value \"0000000000000000043\" to be read as it is and not as \"43\", you would have to mention the data type \"str\" in pre-process file. DvSum source requires to explicitly mention the dataType in such case.\nFor DvSum to read \"Article_ID\" as string and not as number, open pre-process propertiles file and set the dataType as \"str\". Save the pre-process properties files.\nFor more details, please read\nEXCEL Pre-process properties\n4. Upload file again to apply latest preprocess.properties\nOnce you have saved the changes in preprocess properties file, you will be required to upload the file again (same as step 2). This will apply the latest changes to the file.\nThis will clean and format the excel source the way it is required. Now it is ready to be configured in DvSum.\n5. Add Excel in Memory Source\nFrom Administration > Manage Sources > Add Source.\nProvide a name and select the source type as Excel in Memory. You would be required to provide File System Path (root folder path where the excel file is placed)\nSave to add this source in DvSum.\n6. Configure Source\nClick on \"Configure\" button on the bottom left corner. It will show you all the tabs/sheets of your excel source. Select a tab and select the option \"My Data has Headers\". This will show you the name of the columns. Select the columns you want to configure in DvSum.\nNote: The columns that you specified as \"str\" in pre process.properties file are to be explicitly set as \"String\" from configure page.\nWhen you click on \"Add\", those columns will show the status as \"Cataloged\". Click on Finish.\n7. Profile Source\nFrom Profile > Profiling page, select the source and table - Run profiler. Once completed, go to \"Show Details\" to view the data which will now be appearing according to the pre-process properties.\n8. Create Rules\nFrom Profiling, you can create MDC ruleset and DAE rules. You can also create any other rules like Value Range, Blanks check, Orphan Records or Integrity check rules on your excel source.\nExecute the rules to extract exception records. The idea is to use these rules in a workflow and cleanse these there.\n9. Create a Workflow\nFrom Workflows > Manage Workflows, Create a workflow.\nOnce you Save the workflow, you will land on Workflow Designer page. Complete the Workflow by adding Step widgets and making their end to end connection.\nNow in order to add tasks to a step, go to detail page of that step and click on \"Add Task\"\n9.1 File Upload Task\nProvide a name to task and choose type as File Upload Task. In the section File Upload Details, select the same folder that you created in Step 1 (where the file was uploaded). Also, make sure you have checked \"Upload any file\" and \"Apply pre-processing\" options.\n9.2. Validation Task\nProvide a name to task and choose type as \"Validation Task\". In the section Rule List, select the rules created on the configured excel source. You can also select them by filtering rules by source name or Rule group. Also, make sure you have enabled \"Allow dynamic file selection\" check in order to run rules against the dynamic file.\nIf you want the task to be Mandatory, enable Mandatory checkbox.\nThe mandatory step in rule validation can sometimes cause hard-stop in workflow execution. In some cases, it may be acceptable to have exceptions for rule and a user may want to be able to over-ride the failed and mark the validation step as complete by first getting them \"Approved\"\nEnable \"Select Approver\" and select from the group of users or a single user for this role.\nNote\n: Approvers can be appointed only for mandatory Validation Tasks.\n10. Publish workflow\nOnce you have defined the tasks within the steps of workflow, go back to the Workflow Designer window and click on \"Publish\" button. This will change the status of workflow from Draft to Published.\n11. Execute Workflow\nFrom New Workflow Request on the top right corner, create an execution for this workflow.\nProvide the required details and click on Initiate.\n12. Upload dynamic file from workflow\nOnce the execution starts, the step owner will be notified about progress. He/She will then complete the tasks and submit them. User is required to upload a dynamic file, execute validation rules against the uploaded file and cleanse the exceptions.\n12.1 File Upload task\nFrom the task detail page, Click on Upload file and select the file to be uploaded.\nUpon clicking Save, DvSum will apply the pre-process properties to file and cleanse it. Now you can execute the validation rules on it.\n12.2 Validation Rules Task\nFrom the task detail page, Click on Execute. This will show you a dialogue to select a data source against which the rules are to be executed. The file uploaded in previous step will be automatically selected.\nIf the execution of rules passes, then you mark the step as complete. If it fails, you will have the option to cleanse the exceptions or assign step to \"Approver\"\n13. Fix exceptions and assign Step to Approver\nClick on the Validation rule task to see the Rules. You can go to the rule detail page and fix the required exceptions.\nIf there are still exceptions left and you want to be able to over-ride these exceptions and move to the next step of Workflow, assign the step to \"Approver\" to take a decision whether the exceptions fixed are acceptable or not.\nThe Approver can approve the changes and the step can now be marked as complete.\nThe execution will go back to the Step Owner to submit and move to next step of workflow.\nOther Related Articles\nHow can I add new fields in a Excel upload Template?\nData Management Workflow Alerts\nWorkflow Digest Emails\nHow to appoint an Approver for Validation Task in a workflow?\nWho are Watchers and how to add them in a workflow?\nWhat are the types of tasks that can be created in a process step of a workflow?",

    "content": "Rules are created and added to Audits to be run together with other rules.\nRules can also be run individually. They can be scheduled or run ad-hoc.\nRules in DvSum can be created from a number of different locations within the tool. They can also be added from the Rules Library, or if you have existing rules for your data they can also be uploaded to DvSum.\nWhen a rule is created it is assigned a unique ID. The ID will have a form like \"DQ-000167\". DvSum generates a page at a url in the form https://prod.dvsum.com/rules/{rule_id} which includes the Rule Definition, Summary, Exceptions from the latest Audit run, and trends.\nStandard Rule Creation\nThe majority of rules are created through the Rules Wizards provided within the tool. From the left navigation pane, access Audit → Manage Rules, and click \"⊕ Add Rule\".\nCompleting Rules Wizards\nFor each of the Rules wizards, information is completed within the following sections. Depending on the type of Rule, options will differ. If the Rule is applicable to a single data source, Reference Inputs will not apply. Doc-matching rules will also require different information.\nFor some rule types, under Basic Inputs, the Variance Check check-box indicates this is a rule that will compare results of the current run to the results of a previous run, and you will be asked to provide a Variance Threshold or %.\nData Quality Rulesets\nCreating Rules from within Profiling → Data Quality\nWhen in Profiling, by clicking the Data Quality tab, you have the ability to create Rules and Rulesets for the data you are reviewing.\nYou must first click “Enable Ruleset,” complete the required information, and click “Save” before defining the specific checks.\nRules created from the Data Quality tab within Profiling are limited to Completeness and Value Range checks. For example, by selecting the “Blanks Check” check box, the system automatically creates a rule to identify blank or NULL values.\nYou also have the opportunity to establish Filter conditions, to ignore the special scenarios where a blank might be an acceptable value.\nWithin the same Ruleset, or as a standalone Rule, you can also define Value Range Checks. These can be defined based on a Min/Max Threshold, or based on values from a Picklist defined either within the Field or in a reusable Reference Dictionary.\nYour specified configuration is automatically saved as a rule which can be viewed and edited under Audit → Manage Rules.\nData Analysis Exceptions (DAEs)\nCreating Rules from within Profiling → Data Analysis\nMore complex data rules can be created from within Profiling, under the Data Analysis tab. When exploring data through the filtering analysis, you may identify combinations of data that you want to define as Exceptions or that you want to create a query for to review the record details.\nFor example if the combination is invalid and should not exist, a Rule can be created from this view. As seen below, for a Product/Item Category of Accessories (Accy) sourced from Asia, a user may know that the Plan Level (planning category or priority) should not be \"4.\" You can create a rule by clicking \"Add Business Rule\", entering a Description, and clicking Create. A Rule template (or shell) is created, which you may then edit as desired.\nClicking Create takes you Audit → Manage Rules with the Rule template created. From here you can Edit, add detail, Action Items, Create a Workflow, etc. before finalizing the rule.\nYou may also simply choose to click, \"Add Rule\" which takes you to the Rule Editor. Here you will need to recreate the filtering conditions for the Rule you want to create and click \"Add Rule\" which notates the condition under the \"Exceptions Rule List\".\nHere you can specify whether the conditions are valid or invalid. If valid, the rule will be displayed under \"Valid Rule List\". It will consider the condition as valid and bring all other records as exceptions. If invalid, the rule will bring only those records as exception which meet the condition. This can be selected from top right corner.\nWhen creating rules from this view, you are able to create multiple filtering conditions, within the selected Attributes, and also add them as Rules. This creates a compound rule that returns all qualifying exceptions or records within the query, and allows you to view them together. At the bottom, there is Cleanse Column list. Here you can check the columns which you want to make cleanse-able and unchecked any column which serves only as a filter.\nIn the cleanse workbench, the filtered columns with be selected by default and only the cleansable columns will be visible to be fixed.\nAlternatively, DAE rules can also be created from Audit → Manage Rules tab as well.\nSelect \"⊕ Add Rule\" → \"Business Context\" → \"DATA ANALYSIS EXCEPTIONS\".",

Check the \"Include Blanks\" box.\n7. Ensure that the \"Valid\" option is selected for values.\n8. Click the \"Save\" button to apply the changes.\nBy following these steps, you can configure the VR rule to include blanks and ensure the \"Valid\" option is selected for values.\nNote:\nIf \"Include Blanks\" is not checked and \"Valid\" option is selected above, still it won't allow to write back for blank values.\nStep 2 :\nNow click Analysis tab and see on which table the exceptions are showing up as shown below;\nTable Level Check\nStep 3 :\nGo to Profiling section, select source, table name and click the Select button. Once the record is displayed, select it and click Show details option as shown below;\nStep 4 :\nOnce the details page is displayed, select Field Configuration tab.

    "content": "In the past, the functionality of cloning rules did not exist, requiring users to manually create rules each time. However, users can now easily duplicate existing rules with minor adjustments and assign them to other users. This eliminates the need for manual rule creation, saving time and allowing users to create rules quickly using the new clone functionality. For more information on this feature, follow the steps outlined below.\nCloning From Manage Rules Page\nSingle Rule Cloning\nSteps 1 :\nNavigate to the \"Manage Rules\" section and choose a specific rule. Click on \"More Actions\" at the top, then select \"Clone Rule\" from the drop-down menu, as illustrated below:\nStep 2 :\nUpon selecting \"Clone Rule,\" the user will be taken to the Clone Rule detail page. At the top, there will be a prefix and all the clone properties, which will be inherited by default. Users have the flexibility to unselect any property as desired. The cloned rule will have a target source, initially set to the same as the current source by default. However, users can modify it to any other source of their choice, as depicted below:\nStep 3 :\nNow, let's assume the user chooses a different target source for this rule and clicks the \"Clone\" button, as demonstrated below:\nStep 4:\nAfter cloning the rule, the user will be taken to the Clone Summary detail page. In the grid below, you will find the Rule ID, the new ID for the cloned rule (which remains blank in case of failed cloning), the default source of the rule, the source on which the rule has been cloned, the status indicating whether the cloning was successful or failed, any remarks in case of unsuccessful cloning, and finally, a description. In the top right corner, there is a \"Download Summary\" button to download a report of this screen, as illustrated below:\nMultiple Rules Cloning From Different Sources\nStep 5:\nIf the user selects multiple rules belonging to different sources, the same step 1 will be executed. Upon redirecting to the clone detail page, you will observe the prefix, all clone properties, and below that, a target sources section. In the case of multiple rule sources, there will be both \"From Source\" and \"To Source\" options. By default, the \"To Source\" will be the same as the \"From Source,\" but users can modify it later, as depicted below:\nStep 6:\nOn the Clone Summary detail page, you will be able to see the number of rules that encountered errors and those that were successfully cloned, as illustrated below:\nMultiple Rules With Same Source\nStep 7:\nChoose rules that belong to the same source. Opt for the \"Clone Rule\" option, as demonstrated below:\nYou'll encounter a familiar screen as before, but this time, as the rules belong to the same source, there's only one target source displayed. Users can modify the target source if necessary. Simply click the \"Clone\" button, as indicated below:\nUpon successful cloning, you will observe that the two rules have been duplicated, and their details will be displayed as shown below:\nNote:\nA rule that has been cloned can be treated independently from the original (parent) rule on which the cloning was performed. This implies that any configurations made in the cloned rule will not affect the parent rule.\nCloning From Rule Detail Page\nStep 8:\nChoose any rule and navigate to its detail page, where you will find a \"Clone Rule\" button on the top right side, as illustrated below:\nStep 9:\nAfter clicking the \"Clone\" button, you will be directed to the clone detail page. In this specific flow, the information remains consistent, with the addition of displaying the target table on which the rule was created. Users have the option to modify both the target source and target table as needed.\nStep 10:\nIf the user selects a different target table to clone the rule and there's an issue with that target table, the user will receive a notification before the cloning process. For example, if there are data type mismatches between the source and target tables or if there is a structural mismatch, the user will be informed about these errors in advance. Various types of errors may be communicated to the user beforehand, as illustrated below:\nS\ntep 11:\nAfter cloning the rule, the user will be redirected to the rule detail page of the rule on which the cloning was performed. Additionally, a prominent glitter message/ confirmation message will be displayed at the top, indicating the new cloned rule ID.

Later on, after cleansing and write-back operation, there was no such visibility of this action on analyze rule listing page and also in rule detail page unless user had opened cleanse workbench page. There was as such no indication that exceptions were getting fixed or write-back was performed.\nIn order to have visibility, without opening the work-bench, we introduced this new enhancement with the help of which now users will have more visibility about the rule(s) on listing/Rule detail page. To get familiar with this enhancement, let us get started step by step.\nManage Rules >> Rule Detail Page\nStep 1:\nGo to Manage Rule section, select any rule and click on it to open Rule detail page. On this page, you will see a new field added as 'Commit Status'. This field has three new statuses as shown below.\n'Modified' : To be committed\n'Committed' : Write-back has done successfully\n'Commit Failed' : Write-back has failed\nCleanse Bench Detail Page\nStep 2 :\nNow, go to Analysis tab, hit the cleanse button there which opens up the cleanse bench detail page. On top you will see three different sections, 'Suggestions', 'Progress', 'Change History'. In Progress box, you will see total number of Exceptions, remaining ones and under that modified count, committed count and commit failed count is displaying as shown in image below:\nStep 3 : Modified Rule Status\nNow, update any value and you will see that Modified count gets updated from 0 to 1. Also, remaining Exceptions count reduces from 54 to 53 as shown below:\nStep 4: Committed Rule Status\nSave the changes and then hit commit button. After commit gets successful then modified count changes from 1 to 0 and commit count increases from 0 to 1 as shown below:\nStep 5 : Commit Failed Rule Status\nNow, we will try to perform this status scenario. For that, provide any input which is invalid and Save the changes. The modified count gets updated again from 0 to 1  and Remaining count reduces from 53 to 52 as shown below:\nStep 6 :\nAfter saving, now hit the Commit button and observe the following change. Remaining count stays as 52 but modified count changes again from 1 to 0 and since it was an invalid input so commit failed count gets increased by 1 as shown below:\nStep 7 :\nNow we will modify few more records to see the visibility of its status on other different screens. Make sure that you just Save the changes but do not commit it. After this, Modified count gets updated as 5 and Remaining count reduces to 47. The sum of these 3 status and remaining count will be equal to total Exception count as shown below:\nStep 8 :\nNavigate back to Rule detail page and check the count update there. It will be same as it was on cleanse bench detail page. Also, Run status field will show Modified status and icon since we did last modify it as shown below:\nAnalyze Rules >> Rule Listing Page\nStep 9:\nGo to analyze rule page and observe the count update there as well which will be as same as shown above. See image below :\nDashboard Page\nWe have added 2 more widget under Rule History category\nStep 10 :\nSame rule statuses will be shown in all existing widgets on Dashboard created on any particular rule. A new widget is added\nException detail History\nas shown below: It will show the commutative count for run result and other 3 rule statuses.\nStep 11 :\nNow click on \"\nRun status of Rules by weekly Run date\n\" to view report.

Upon saving the changes, the user will be redirected to the Table's detail page, where the following updates will be visible, as shown in the image below:\nA - In the \"Field Configuration\" tab, \"CUSTOMER_ID\" is now displayed at the top in the Column name.\nB - The \"Default Sequence\" label is updated to \"Custom Sequence.\"\nC - The \"Default Sequence\" button is now enabled.\nClicking the \"Default Sequence\" button will reset the applied customized sequencing to its default state.\nStep 4\nCustomized Sequencing Confirmation II\nAfter setting the customized sequence in the \"Field Configuration\" tab, when you go to the \"Profiling\" tab, you'll see the same sequence applied. The \"Custom Sequence\" label will be visible on this screen as well.\nCustomized Sequencing Confirmation III\nClick on \"Profiling\" from the left navigation menu, and you will see an icon appearing against the table on which the user has applied a Custom Sequence, as depicted in the image below:\nStep 5:\nIf the user wants to reset the custom sequencing to its default sequencing, there are two ways to do that, as shown in the image below:\nStep 5.1:\n- Go to the Profiling main page.\n- Select the table on which custom sequencing is applied.\n- Click the \"More Actions\" button.\n- Finally, click on the \"Reset Column Sequence\" option.\nStep 5.2:\nUsers can also apply default sequencing on multiple records with the following actions:\n- Select multiple records on which custom sequencing is applied.\n- Click the \"More Actions\" button.\n- Then select the \"Reset Column Sequence\" option.\nNote: In case of multiple records, if there exists any single record with the default sequence, then the \"\nReset Column Sequence\n\" option in the \"More Actions\" button will remain disabled until the user un-selects that particular record.\nThe second way to reset custom sequencing to default sequencing is as follows:\n1. Select any record on the Profiling detail page.\n2. Click \"Show Details.\"\n3. Navigate to the \"Field Configuration\" tab.\n4. Click the \"Default Sequence\" button, as shown in the image below:\nOnce the user has reset the custom sequence to the default sequence, the applied changes will revert back to their default settings on the following sections:\nA - The \"Custom Sequence\" label will be replaced back with the \"Default Sequence\" label.\nB - The \"Default Sequence\" button will be disabled again.\nC - The column(s) sequence will be set to the default sequence.\nD - The custom sequence icon will disappear.\nRule Level Column Sequencing\nNote:\nColumn Sequencing at Rule level is only applicable for following rules as listed below:\nA- Blank Rule\nB- Value Range Rule\nC- Data Analysis Exception Rule\nD- Master Data-set Rule\nE- Data Format Rule\nF- Orphan Records Rule\nG- Integrity Check Rule\nStep 6\nTo begin with Column Sequencing at the Rule Level, we'll consider three scenarios, starting with Scenario I. For each of these scenarios, let's create a rule from scratch. Follow these steps:\n1. Go to \"Manage Rules.\"\n2. Click on the \"Add Rule\" button.\n3. Select the \"Business Context\" option.\n4. Then, click on \"Value Range\" rule.\nScenario I  -  Table Specific :\nWhen the user selects the data source and table name on which custom sequencing is applied, follow these steps:\n1. Provide a rule description.\n2. Select the data source.\n3. Choose the table name.\n4. Select the field name.\n5. Enter the maximum and minimum threshold values.\n6. Hit the \"Save\" button.\nIn Scenario I, when the user lands on the Rule detail page, a new tab called \"Column Sequence\" becomes visible. This tab appears for rules where Rule-level column sequencing is enabled. Under this section, three options are displayed.\nA- Suggested\nB- Table Specific\nC- Rule Specific\nIn the current scenario, Option B will be selected by default. This represents the logic that when a rule is created on a Table/Source that already has Custom Sequencing applied, the sequence of columns in the rule will be the same as the Table-level sequencing. In the \"Selected Columns\" section, the column(s) on which the rule is created or the Primary Key column will always appear as disabled. Additionally, the \"Analysis\" tab initially appears as disabled. Re-run the rule to enable the Analysis tab.\nAfter the user has re-run the rule, the \"Analysis\" tab gets enabled. Click on the \"Analysis\" tab and verify that the sequence of columns is the same as it was on the table level, as shown in the image below. Click on the \"Cleanse\" button, and you will see the same sequence as it is on the \"Analysis\" tab and \"Column Sequence\" tab.\nStep 7\nIf the user changes the column sequence at the Table level, upon navigating back to the rule(s) in the \"Column Sequence\" tab, a warning message will notify the user to re-run the rule in order to see the updated sequence in the \"Analysis\" tab, as shown in the image below. Once the user re-runs the rule, the sequence gets updated in the \"Column Sequence\" tab, \"Analysis\" tab, and the \"Cleanse\" section.\nScenario II - Rule Specific :\nWhen user apply custom sequence at Rule level\nNow, go back to the \"Column Sequence\" tab. Change the sequence of the column(s). As soon as you change the sequence, the option changes automatically from Table specific to Rule Specific. Hit the \"Save\" button. The user will be notified through a Warning message to re-run the rule to see the updated sequence in the \"Analysis\" tab, as shown in the image below. Once the user re-runs the rule, the sequence gets updated in the \"Column Sequence\" tab, \"Analysis\" tab, and the \"Cleanse\" section.\nScenario III - Suggested :\nUser creates a rule on Table on which No custom sequencing is applied.\nCertainly! Here are the steps to complete Step 6:\n1. Provide a rule description.\n2. Select the data source.\n3. Choose the table name.\n4. Select the field name.\n5. Enter the maximum and minimum threshold values.\n6. Hit the \"Save\" button.\nIn Scenario III, when the user lands on the Rule detail page, in the \"Column Sequence\" tab, the \"Suggested\" option will be selected by default. However, the \"Table Specific\" option will appear as disabled.\nA- Suggested\nB- Table Specific\nC- Rule Specific\nAdditionally, the \"Analysis\" tab appears as disabled initially. Re-run the rule to enable the \"Analysis\" tab.\nNote:\nColumns that has exceptions will always appear upfront in case of Suggested option.\nMeanwhile, if the user applies custom sequencing at the Table level for the same table on which the above rule is created, then upon navigating back to the Column Sequencing section, the \"Table\" option gets enabled, as shown in the image below:\nStep 8\nNow, from here, select the \"Table Specific\" option. The column sequencing below gets updated with respect to the Table level. Also, if rule level sequencing is already applied to this rule, then on selecting the \"Rule Specific\" option, column sequencing gets updated with respect to the Rule level. However, to see the results in the \"Analysis\" and \"Cleanse\" tabs for Table level and Rule level changes, the user will always have to re-run the rule.\nCase 1:\nFor instance, if the user switches the option from 'Suggested' to the 'Table Specific' option, the sequence gets updated. After clicking the \"Save\" button, it notifies the user through a Warning message to re-run the rule in order to see the updated sequence in the \"Analysis\" and \"Cleanse\" tabs.\nCase 2:\nNow, in \"Table Specific,\" if the user changes the column sequence further, then the option switches from 'Table Specific' to 'Rule Specific' instantly. After clicking the \"Save\" button, it notifies the user through a Warning message to re-run the rule in order to see the updated sequence in the \"Analysis\" and \"Cleanse\" tabs.\nNote:\nIf the user has created multiple rules against a single table, each rule can have its own unique column sequencing.\nStep 9\nAs per the functionality, a maximum of 30 columns can be displayed on the Analysis tab. For instance, if a user selects a table that has 50 columns and creates a rule on the column that comes at the 40th number, the following behavior will be observed:\nA-\nSuggested:\nThe column name gets displayed upfront in the Column Sequencing/Analysis/Cleanse tab.\nB-\nTable/Rule Specific:\nThe column name gets displayed on the 31st number.",

    "content": "User will be able to perform write-back for SAP source using DvSum application. On opening cleanse workbench for the rules configured with SAP source, resolving the exception and performing commit, data will be written back to SAP source.\nSAP User Based Credentials\nDvSum application allows users to cleanse the datasets and write back directly on the source database. SAP database is a new addition as a source in DvSum application. For allowing user to write back on SAP source, the user needs to configure the SAP user credentials in DvSum Application. DvSum application will use those credentials for connecting to the source and enabling user to perform different actions on the source data.\nThere is a section in user profile page where user can setup the sap credentials for sources which have user-based write-back enabled. User will select the source and add the username and password for that source. User can also use Test connection button to test the connection with sap source with entered credentials.\nFor enabling, user will have to enable user based writeback in writeback parameters.\nWhen a user enters the credentials, these will be saved. Only one credentials can be added for one sap source for each user.\nAuthorization needs to be provided for a user to be able to do writeback. He should have access to to ZDVSUM* functional module in SAP.\nSAP Writeback Configuration Setup\nUser will now be able to Writeback Data into SAP Application System using Database Source (Ex: SAP MD) by doing certain configuration in DvSum Application at Source Level and Table Level. To know how to setup the configuration one by one, let us get started step by step.\nSource Level Configuration:\nStep 1:\nTo link an existing source connection to SAP, user should navigate to 'Administration' > 'Manage Sources' > select the source to be linked to SAP and click on 'Edit Source'\nStep 2:\nOn Clicking 'Edit Source' (Other than SAP), user will be able to see the following page.\nIn the 'Source Write back Mapping' section, Select the SAP Source to which Data should be Writeback. 'Write back On parameter' must be selected as \"Linked SAP source\" in order for write-back to be performed on SAP source.\nAfter selecting the “Linked SAP Source” and “Writeback On”, Save the Details by clicking on Save button.\nNote:  'Write back On' parameter selected as \"Original Source\", DvSum will write back to Original source.\nTable Level Configuration:\nThere can be multiple scenarios for setting the Table level configurations and do the writeback\nScenario A: Reading from SAP and writing to SAP\nStep 1:\nIn Order to Writeback to SAP Table using SAP Source, First Verify the Record Identifiers are set for the SAP Table by Navigating to Profiling > Selected SAP Table > More Actions > Edit Configuration as shown below\nStep 2:\nIn Order to Writeback to SAP Table using DB Source, First Verify the Record Identifiers are set for the SAP Table by Navigating to Profiling > Selected SAP Table > More Actions > Edit Configuration as shown below\nNow Verify the Record Identifier’s in the below location. If the Record Identifier’s are not set, Please set them here and Save.\nStep 3:\nStarting from creating a rule, Value Range rule type in this case, go to Manage Rules, click on Add Rule button, hover on Business Context from drop down options and lastly click on Value Range\nas shown in image below\n:\nAfter the running the rule, now we can see the Cleanse button and Writeback Fields marked with colour.\nStep 4:\nNow, click on Cleanse Button, Modify the Data as shown below.\nStep 5:\nOnce the Save is done. Click on “Commit” button to writeback data into SAP Table.\nAs soon as commit is pressed, user can see Job(s) are scheduled to perform the operation.\nWait for the Jobs to complete by Navigating to Scheduler Page.\nStep 6:\nVerify the changes on the Rule Page by refreshing the page, once the Job(s) are completed.\nScenario B: Reading from MSSQL Database and writing to SAP\nStep 1:\nNow, navigate to Profile > Profiling page. Select the DB Source Table (Ex: SAP_MD QA , DBO>MARADBO.TVARTICLEPURCHASING_GROUP) as shown below for which User wants to create a rule and do the writeback.\nStep 2:\nVerify the Record Identifiers are same as the SAP Table. If not, please select the record Identifiers for DB Source Table and click Next.\nMake sure the key identifier is set against Source Identifier and the column which we want to use for cleansing purposes, enable writeback must be checked for it in Column Mapping section as shown in the image below. After setting the configuration, press Save.\nNote: Please make sure to set the Key identifier for the Target SAP source as well like we set for the above data source\nStep 3:\nStarting from creating a rule, Value Range rule type in this case, go to Manage Rules, click on Add Rule button, hover on Business Context from drop down options and lastly click on Value Range\nas shown in image below\n:\nStep 4:\nAfter the running the rule, now we can see the Cleanse button and Writeback Fields marked with colour.\nStep 5:\nNow, click on Cleanse Button, Modify the Data as shown below.

Here, user can see the Writeback is going to Perform on SAP Table (MARC)\nStep 13:\nOnce the Save is done. Click on “Commit” button to writeback data into SAP Table.\nAs soon as commit is pressed, user can see Job(s) are scheduled to perform the operation.\nWait for the Jobs to complete by Navigating to Scheduler Page.\nStep 14:\nVerify the changes on the Rule Page by refreshing the page, Once the Job(s) are completed.\nHow the Commit Works\nOn setting up the configurations are set based on any of the above mentioned four scenarios, user will run the rule and see the pink colour for exceptions. User will click on Cleanse button and make the changes. While making changes, there is an ability where you can group the fields like the one mentioned below\nOn saving the changes and pressing commit, it will create a job. User will have to wait for the job to get completed. On job completion, user will receive the email template like below\nIf user wants to see the status of ongoing job, user can navigate to Review > Scheduler section to view the current status of the job.\nControl Options\nUser can run the mass update in multiple batches. In order to configure batches, go to Manage Sources and define Batch Size.\nBatch Size Variable\nThere is another variable called Writeback Batch Size that will limit the number of records that can be included in a single Batch Job at any given time.  Currently, in SAP QA1, this is set to 1,000.  Thus, if the data teams were to submit a job to cleanse the 75,000 records mentioned above, the DVSum system would create 75 executable jobs under that Batch Job, each with 1,000 changes.\nthe DvSum process to commit the jobs for changing in SAP, the 75 jobs would be placed in DvSum’s job queue with 1 job marked with the status ‘Scheduled’ and 74 jobs marked with the status ‘Stand by’.  The job in status ‘Scheduled’ will wait until the scheduled time to begin and then will switch to status ‘Running’ until the time that SAP returns after the completion of that work process.\nUpon receiving the return from SAP, DvSum will mark that job with the status ‘Completed’ and will mark the next job with the status ‘Scheduled’ with a start time set for the next change in minute. This process will continue until all 75 jobs have been sequentially executed until completion or until one of the following events occurs:\nDvSum user places the Job on\nhold\n– This action in DvSum will place all jobs\nnot currently in execution within SAP\nto the status ‘On Hold’ and will prevent DvSum from sending the remaining jobs to SAP for execution until such a time as the DvSum user releases the jobs to continue their execution.  This action will not stop the job currently being executed by the SAP System, but it will prevent any subsequent jobs from being sent.\nDvSum user deletes the Job in Running\n– This action in DvSum should place the current job to the status ‘Completed (Aborted)’, and all subsequent Stand by jobs for this batch will be put on ‘On Hold’ job status.\nSAP Basis user cancels the work process\n– This action should terminate the current work process in SAP, and set the status of running job to errored and any subsequent jobs scheduled for that Batch should be changed to status ‘On Hold’ until such a time that the SAP Basis team allows the continuation of Batch Job processing.\nWhen the status of all the subsequent jobs get completed, user will go to the respective rule details page and refresh it.\nIf the colour of the submitted exceptions is green, this means the writeback happened successfully.\nIf the colour of the submitted exceptions gets orange, this means the writeback operation got failed. To know the possible error, click on cleanse button and hover exclamation mark in Change History section. It will tell you the possible reason of failure and analyse with your SAP team to resolve the error.",

Specifying this as \"Valid\" range, this rule will show the records where Ending_Date is less than Starting_Date as exceptions.\nThe same case can be started the other way where a user can create a rule on \"Ending_Date\" and provide threshold as less than the \"Starting_Date\" to define \"Invalid\" records. Both the use cases will return same exceptions.\nRange Value\nFor the Range values, you need to provide the minimum and maximum threshold.\nHere you have 3 options. You can provide an absolute value, like 10 or you can use Reference column of the table. Threshold Max would be less than equal to the column Title. You can also opt for a custom expression.\nField Dictionary\nField dictionary\nprovides you with a list of values in the selected column which makes it easier to pick out the records you want as valid or invalid. Lets say we select as 2001-02 as invalid. This rule execution will bring records with Starting_Date as 2001-02 as exception in result.\nReference Dictionary\nFor reference dictionary with Valid values, the rule execution will bring the records with values that don't exist in dictionary as exceptions in result. For the Field \"is_current' any value other than the ref dictionary will be exceptions.\nNote: You can create your own Reference Dictionary from Profile tab or you can see\nHow to create and use Reference Dictionary\nInclude Blanks\nAnother small yet powerful check you can integrate with this rule is \"Include Blanks\". As an example below, a user can specify \"Valid Range\" of values and check-mark the Include Blanks. This mean the blank fields in the column \"is_current\" will not be shown as exceptions in rule result.\nFor the same case, if \"Invalid\" is selected, blank fields in the column \"is_current\" will be shown as exceptions along with any value within the range 10-20.",

    "content": "Rules in DvSum can be executed from the UI, scheduled through the scheduler and can also be called programmatically using an API. To run a rule or set of rules through a script, you can generate a script for those rules using the Schedule Rule Menu.\nThe script takes the form of\nhttps://<saws\naddress>:<saws_port>/runJob?jobId=<jobid>\nThe script runs the rule exactly like running from the UI or the Scheduler, with the difference being what is returned back from the script. Below is a screenshot of what is returned from the script. The 2 elements are  return_code and return_remark.\nThe return_code always contains 3 values\n0  - PASS if rule has 0 exceptions or exceptions are less than lower bound of threshold\n-1 - WARN if the rule has exceptions but exceptions are greater than lower bound but less than upper bound\n-2  - FAIL if the rule has exceptions that are greater than upper bound limit.\nThe return_remark contains text that will provide the name of the rule additional information that you typically see in system remark field in the Rule Detail page.\nExample\nThis rule has threshold set between 0 - 300\nSince exception are 256 which is > 0 but less than <300, the return_code is -1 as a Warning.\nExecuting the rule via API:\nUsers can generate the script for the rule and use the script URL to execute the rule. Lets get started step by step:\nStep 1:\nOpen the Dvsum application, go to Audit >> Manage Rules >> select any existing rule >> click More action >> select Schedule Rule as shown below:\nStep 2:\nDynamic Source Script Generation\nGo to Generate Script tab and click on the button at the bottom to generate the script as shown below;\nStep 2.1:\nA job is created against the rule. Now go to the main scheduler page, search the rule, and a newly created job will be visible with a description and status as “stand by”.\nStep 3:\nCopy the script url and paste it into Google Chrome and press Enter. Execution starts and on dvsum application, the job description and status get executed as well.\nStep 3.1:\nOnce the execution is completed. it will print the remarks same as shown on the rule detail page in Dvsum.\nOn the Scheduler page, the job status changes to \"Completed\".\nExecuting the rule API via ADF:\nStep 1:\nFor the existing Rule, select schedule to Generate the script URL as shown above, and copy the url.\nStep 1.1:\nA job is created against the rule. Now go to the main scheduler page, search the rule, and a newly created job will be visible with a description and status as “stand by”.\nStep 2:\nGo to Azure Data Factory and paste the copied URL in api call. Click on Debug button to start the execution.\nStep 2.1:\nOnce the execution is completed. it will print the remarks in API call output same as shown on the rule detail page in Dvsum.\nOn the Scheduler page, the job status changes to \"Completed\".",

    "content": "What are Rule Groups?\nRule Groups are\ntags\nthat allow you to organize your rules into categories. (They were formerly known as \"Val Groups\", so you'll see this terminology in some documentation.) You can apply a Rule Group tag in order to categorize DvSum Rules. Rule groups are like folders, but unlike folders you can apply more than one Rule Group tag to a single rule. Likewise, a rule can belong to multiple Rule Groups.\nUsing Rule Groups\nFor instance, the user \"Dani DataSteward\" wants to group together a few rules she created. She can create a Rule Group called \"Dani DataSteward Rules\". She can then filter the \"Analyze Rules\" grid by Rule Group. This gives her the flexibility to tag rules that were not created by her as part of this Rule Group.\nAdditionally, under Review → Batch Execution an administrator can execute multiple rules tagged with a specified set of Rule Groups very easily.\nCreating Rule Groups\nWhile creating a rule\nA user can add Rule Groups from the \"Add Rule\" wizard when creating a new rule. As the user starts typing in the field \"Rule Group\", the list of existing Rule Groups appears. If the desired rule group does not already exist, then\nhit Enter to create the new Rule Group\n. (Note that the screenshot below shows the historic\nlabel\n\"Val Group\" rather than the current label \"Rule Group\".)\nWhile editing a rule\nYou can also add New Rule Groups from rule detail page. Edit the rule summary information. The Rule Group drop down displays the list of existing rule groups. To create a new one, simply type the name and press Enter.\nWhile performing a Mass Update\nOn the pages \"Manage Rules\" and \"Analyze Rules\", you have the option to perform a Mass Update. Under the field \"Rule Group\", you can select from the existing list or type to create a new rule group.\nRemove Rules from a Rule Group\nWhile editing a rule summary it's possible to remove any currently assigned rule groups.\nAdditionally, on the pages \"Manage Rules\" and \"Analyze Rules\" you may select rules and click on More Actions → Mass Update. This interface provide the ability to remove (or add) rule groups.\nYou have the following options regarding Rule Groups:\nAdd following Rule Groups\nReplace existing Rule Groups with following\nRemove following Rule Groups (pictured above)",

    "url": "https://dvsum.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/230178488-Types-of-Rules-Wizards",
    "content": "Types of Rules Wizards\nWe encourage customers to begin by identifying whatever data errors are causing impacts to their business and start with rules to identify those exceptions. Some of the rule types are straightforward, and their relevance is obvious. Others were created for specific customer use cases, and the potential application to your environment may not be readily apparent. Over time, potential rules and use cases become more apparent as you build out a more complete data governance approach.\nThe rules wizards are organized into the following categories:\nFoundational DQ\nBasic, logical checks you would typically do in any environment. Includes completeness, consistency, and validity checks.\nPipeline Checks\nValidates data pipelines by verifying data quantities, assessing data quality and performance, and monitoring data timeliness within the data processing workflows. Enhances data flow, quality, and efficiency.\nCross System DQ\nValidations and checks based on a specific business understanding of what the data should be.\nMDM\nIs the data valid or what is expected based on the process or purpose. Includes accuracy checks.\nData Diffs\nCompare and reconcile details and records across systems – without having to consolidate or pull the data. Includes consistency and validity checks.\nWithin these categories are various rule types that can be configured to validate data and generate exceptions. There may also be different approaches to start with different rule types that generate the Exceptions you’re looking for. We encourage users to explore different rules and approaches, as there is an art to determining what works best within your environment and business processes.\nType of Audit Rule\nDefinition\nExample (s)\nFoundational DQ\nBLANKS\nAvailability and completeness of data. Are there missing values?\nAll the records where address field is missing in customer ship-to information.\nVALUE RANGE\nAre the values in data within the expected range? Either within a continuous range, within a pick list, or one of a specific value.\nManufacturing yield should always be between 0.01 and 1\nOrder type in sales orders should only be one of ZOST, ZOCO, ZOFR.\nItem_category in shipments should only be one of the values in the item_category reference\nUNIQUENESS\nAre the values within a data element unique in the dataset?\nDuplicate customers in customer table. Data is not unique. Duplicate keys and their count are displayed.\nUNIQUE VALUES\nAre the Count of Unique Values within an acceptable range or equal to a defined number?\nExpect unique locations to be between 95-100 based on 100 ship-from locations. Over 100 indicates error. Under 95 indicates potential error.\nCUSTOM QUERY\nAbility to write custom SQL.\nAny custom SQL query.\nDATA FORMAT\nAre the values in the data conforming to predefined formats, or users defining their own formats or patterns, such as SSN, Email etc. ensuring consistency and accuracy.\nExpect 2 values after decimal point in employee IDs field , if employee ID violates the rules's expected format, it would be considered a potential error.\nDefining pattern and then providing regex expression in the filter modal.\nPipeline Checks\nCOUNT\nIs the count of records within the expected range?\nCount of sales orders in open order extract should be between 800k and 1M records.\nFreshness\nMonitors if data is not present or updated by a certain time.\nIn a weather forecasting app:\nData initially fetched at \"2023-09-30 08:00:00.\"\nNext execution timestamp: \"2023-09-30 14:30:00.\"\nTime difference: 6 hours.\nDefined threshold: 3 hours.\nif the difference is more than the defined difference, it should be alerting.\nMetric\nIs the aggregated quantity within the expected range?\nSum of open order quantity should be between 75M and 100M units.\nCross System DQ\nORPHAN RECORDS\nRecord exists in one system’s set of records, but not in another system’s set of what should be the same records.\nOrder A exists in the ERP’s list of Orders, but not in the Transportation System’s list of Planned Orders.\nORPHAN KEYS\nGroup of Records of a certain type exist in one system but not in another. Summarized by type.\nShipments for Customer X not found in list of Shipments by Customer.\nProduct Category B is found in the list of shipments, but it is not found in list of Products.\nINTEGRITY CHECK\nDoes valid data exist in reference systems to execute a process?\nDoes each SKU have a valid Bill-of-Distribution?\nDoes each Item have weight/measure populated?\nMDM\nADDRESS VALIDATION\nValidates existing address against Google Maps. Also enables standardization.\n123 Main Rd should actually be 123 W Main St.\nDOC-MATCHING\nCompare records at a field level and highlight discrepancies.\nFor Planned Orders in ERP vs Planned Orders in Warehouse System: validate dates, quantity, and price and show discrepancies\nData Diffs\nCOMPARE COUNT\nCompare the count of records between 2 different data sources. The test may be at same or different granularities.\nCompare total Orders or Shipments in ERP at transactional level to Order or Shipment summary loaded in data warehouse at aggregated level.\nCOMPARE CUSTOM QUERY\nCreate your own custom validation rule within one data set and compare to the same query in a separate data set or system.\nCompare totals in the operational system of record to a downstream system and to an enterprise data warehouse.\nCOMPARE METRIC\nCompare aggregated quantity between 2 different data sources.\nCompare the total shipment volume for last 3 months in ERP with shipment volume loaded in data warehouse at aggregated level.\nCOMPARE TABLE\nHolistic comparison of the count of records and volume for metric fields across different attributes.\nCompare Open Sales Orders in SAP with Sales Order extract in JDA for count, total of orderquantity, qtyopen by order_type, item_category, plant, key customer accounts, product line.\nCOMPARE SCHEMA\nCompare the schema structure between two sources, highlight differences in tables and columns, include disparities in data types where applicable.\nCompare schema definitions between the operational system of record, a downstream system, and an enterprise data warehouse to ensure consistency and identify any discrepancies in table structures and column definitions.\nRuleset\nRuleset is a predefined set of data constraints, It ensures data accuracy by enforcing rules such as disallowing blank values, restricting values to a specified range, and validating data formats for columns like strings or numbers.\nExample:\nCustomer_ID can't be left blank, and the \"Country\" column should only have two-character inputs like US or UK.",
